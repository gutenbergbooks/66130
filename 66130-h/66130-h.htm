</div>


<p>The original intention of this work was to arrange a treatise,
in the form of a compilation, of general and local information
on water supply, in all its bearings, with special reference to
Cincinnati, in view of the fact that the question of a new supply
would become an important one when the “Markley Farm
Project” presented a more tangible form.</p>

<p>As the work progressed, its scope became broader, so much
so that the author was induced to depart somewhat from the
original idea, and arrange the plan in a more comprehensive
form for general use.</p>

<p>To condense a large amount of information in a few pages,
so as to make it interesting as well as intelligent, is a work
requiring patience and diligence. While the work may be of
little service to the profession, it is hoped those connected
with water-works and the general reader will find sufficient
compensation for the time lost in its perusal.</p>

<p>The authorities quoted are the highest, and the general facts
are from the most reliable sources. Considerable space is given
to pollution of water, believing it to be the most important
question that bears on the subject before us. Water-works
officials will find useful information in the work, which is so frequently
desired and sometimes difficult to obtain.</p>

<h2 class="p1 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>It is an historical fact that the water supply of Rome, during
the first century of our era, was so abundant “that whole rivers
flowed through the streets of Rome.” The quantity was estimated
at 375 million gallons per day, an equivalent to 375
gallons for each inhabitant. This supply was conducted to the
city through nine costly and marvelous conduits of brick and
stone, that tunneled hills and crossed rivers and ravines in the
boldest manner, presenting most skillful engineering ability.
The number was afterwards increased to fourteen. The principal
aqueducts were: Aqua Martia, erected B. C. 431, was 38
miles in length, part of which was composed of 7,000 arches.
Aqua Claudia, a subterranean channel for 36¼ miles; 10¾
miles a surface conduit, 3 miles a vaulted tunnel, and 7 miles
on lofty arcades, had a capacity for delivering 96 million gallons
daily. New Anio was 43 miles in length. Some of
these aqueducts were made of three distinct arches, one above
the other, that conveyed waters from sources of different elevations.</p>

<p>Constantinople presents remains of the skill possessed by
the Romans in the numerous subterraneous reservoirs, covered
with stone arcades supported by pillars. Pont du Gard is
another relict that supplied the town of Nismes, France.
“It consists of 3 tiers of arches, the lowest of 6 arches, supporting
11 of equal span in the center tier, surmounted by 35
of smaller size. Its height is 180 feet, the channel way being
5 feet high by 10 feet wide; the capacity was estimated at 14
million gallons per day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>In Mexico and Peru are found water channels of marvelous
length, while India is noted for the numerous impounding reservoirs
of wonderful dimensions,&mdash;the Poniary reservoir, having
an area of 50,000 acres, and banks 50 miles in extent.</p>

<p>While the ancients have left monuments of their skill in gathering
and conducting waters, modern science has been, and is,
endeavoring to leave a reputation for its devotion to the knowledge
of pollution in, and purification of waters required for
mankind.</p>

<p>The vast amount of literature devoted to this subject, containing
a varied scope of discussions, arguments and analyses,
has a tendency to lead one to the conclusion that wholesome
water scarcely exists. In fact, the theory advanced by the
Massachusetts State Board of Health, in their Fifth Annual
Report, is not so premature. They say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The time may come when it will be necessary to supply our
drinking water from sedulously guarded but limited sources of supply,
and to furnish for manufacturing and other uses less pure water.
This plan is partly carried out in Paris, and it is the purpose to
enlarge it, although much of the water is unfit to drink.</p>

<p>“The injurious character of a water, impregnated with sewage
matter, might not be discovered for years. You might go on using it
for years and might not be discovered, and you might have some outbreak
of disease in the place, which nevertheless might be connected
with the use of that sewage water.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Rivers Pollution Commission of Great Britain struggled
with this subject for six years, and at last resolved upon the
following classification of potable waters:</p>

<p>The constituent parts of pure water, in volumes, are two
parts of hydrogen and one of oxygen, and by weight one part
hydrogen and eight parts oxygen. When pure it is transparent,
tasteless, inodorous, and colorless, except when seen in
considerable depths. But having such high solvent powers and
affinity for almost every substance in nature, one can account
for suspicions that science places on all waters, for it is never
free from impurities. And well it may not, if doctors are to
be believed, for they tell us, that chemically pure water is not
best for man; that good potable waters have from one to eight
grains weight in each gallon of certain impurities diffused
through them. Impurities are arranged under the following
general heads:</p>

<p>Rain Water&mdash;Atmospheric influences.</p>

<p>Spring and Well Water&mdash;Mineral properties.</p>

<p>Rivers, Lakes&mdash;Vegetable and animal organisms.</p>

<p>But what can we consider good drinking water? Dr. Frankland,
of England, has given the following as a minimum limit
of mechanical and chemical impurities held in suspension or
solution, to be considered bad or polluted liquid:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>A.</em> Every liquid which has not been submitted to precipitation,
produced by a perfect repose in reservoirs of sufficient
dimensions, during a period of at least six hours; or which,
having been submitted to precipitation, contains in suspension
more than one part by weight of dry organic matter in 100,000
parts of liquid; or which, not having been submitted to precipitation,
contains in suspension more than three parts by weight
of dry mineral matter, or one part by weight of dry organic
matter in 100,000 parts of liquid.</p>

<p><em>B.</em> Every liquid containing in solution more than two parts
by weight of organic carbon, or three parts of organic nitrogen,
in 100,000 parts of liquid.</p>

<p><em>C.</em> Every liquid which, when placed in a white porcelain
vessel to the depth of one inch, exhibits under daylight distinct
color.</p>

<p><em>D.</em> Every liquid which contains in solution, in every 100,000<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
parts by weight, more than two parts of any metal, except
calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium.</p>

<p><em>E.</em> Every liquid which in every 100,000 parts by weight contains
in solution, suspension, chemical combination or otherwise,
more than 0.5 metallic arsenic.</p>

<p><em>F.</em> Every liquid which, after the addition of sulphuric acid,
contains in every 100,000 parts by weight more than one part
of free chlorine.</p>

<p><em>G.</em> Every liquid which in every 100,000 parts by weight contains
more than one part of sulphur, in the state of sulphuretted
hydrogen or of a soluble sulphuret.</p>

<p><em>H.</em> Every liquid having an acidity superior to that produced
by adding two parts by weight of hydrochloric acid to 1000 parts
of distilled water.</p>

<p><em>I.</em> Every liquid having an alkalinity greater than that produced
by adding one part by weight of caustic soda to 1000
parts of distilled water.</p>

<p><em>J.</em> Every liquid exhibiting on its surface a film of petroleum,
or hydrocarbon, or containing in suspension, in 100,000 parts,
more than 0.5 of such oils.</p>
</div>

<p>But to arrive at a fair and impartial conclusion, authorities
now agree that analyses and investigations must be often, and
for a prolonged period of not less than one year. The aim of
modern scientists, in their analyses, is to detect the amount of
organic (especially sewage) contamination. Dr. Frankland’s
method is by the estimation of organic carbon and nitrogen,
while Wanklyn, Chapman, and Smith reach their conclusions by
estimation of nitrogenous organic matter, by breaking up the
organic bodies and separating their nitrogen in the form of
albuminoid ammonia. Ammonia is the measure of that portion
of organic matter not decomposed but in state of or capable of
undergoing putrefaction.</p>

<p>The maximum amount of free ammonia permissible in good
drinking water is .5 of a grain per 1000 gallons, and of albuminoid
ammonia .9 of a grain <ins class="corr" id="tn-8" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'per 1000 gollons'">per 1000 gallons</ins>.</p>

<p>Upon the above basis the relative merits of the following
waters may be formed:</p>

<p class="p2">The Rivers Pollution Commission value the quality of water
by the previous sewage or animal contamination, as they term
it. This expression is obtained by taking, as a standard of
comparison, the amount of total combined nitrogen (which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
assumed as 10 parts), in solution, in 100,000 parts of average
London sewage. The parts of nitrogen obtained, in the form
of nitrates, nitrites, and ammonia, less .032 part of 100,000 for
that portion in rain, is that nitrogen derived from animal matter.
Animal matters dissolved in water, such as those contained
in sewage, the contents of privies and cess-pools, or farm-yard
manure, undergo oxidation in lakes, rivers and streams very
slowly, but, in the pores of an open soil, very rapidly. When
this oxidation is complete, they are resolved into mineral
compounds; their carbon is converted into carbonic acid;
and their hydrogen into water; but their nitrogen is transformed
partly into ammonia and chiefly into nitrous and nitric acids.

it contains previous animal sewage, but does not exceed
10,000 parts in 100,000 parts of water. Suspicious or doubtful
water is, first, river or flowing water which exhibits any proportion,
however small, of previous sewage; and, second, well
or spring water containing 10,000 to 20,000 parts. Dangerous
water is, first, river or flowing water which exhibits more than
20,000 parts of previous animal contamination; second, river
or flow water containing less than 20,000 parts of previous
contamination, coming from sewage discharged into it directly,
or mingling with it as surface drainage; third, well or deep-seated
springs containing more than 20,000 parts, because previous
contamination is in direct proportion to the amount of
such contamination.</p>

<p>The value of an analysis, sanitarily considered, is questioned.
Mr. Simon, medical officer of Her Majesty’s Privy Council, testified,
before the Royal Commission on Water Supply, on this
point, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There are dangerous qualities of water supply with regard to which,
so far as I know, chemists are totally unable to measure, even to demonstrate
the fatal influences that a water may have. A water may
be, for instance, capable of spreading the cholera, but chemists be
unable to identify the particular contamination which produces that
effect. It is, I think, a matter of absolute demonstration that, in the
old epidemics, when the south side of London suffered so dreadfully
from cholera, the great cause of the immense mortality there was
a badness of the water supply then distributed in those districts of
London.”</p>
</div>

<p>Prof. Frankland says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That we have no reason to believe that the injurious character of
either sewage or of the gases from a drain depends fundamentally
upon the quality of that sewage or of that gas. In all probability it
far more depends upon the quality of the sewage, namely, what it
consists of. Now, what is the nature of the poisonous matter in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
atmosphere or in the sewage? We do not know that, at all; therefore
you can not possibly say when that poisonous matter is got rid of
from the water or from the air. Chemical analysis can not do it, for
its limit is by the power of weighing and measuring. It is not sufficiently
advanced, and is one of the poorest things possible to reach
those delicate points.”</p>
</div>

<p>Vital statistics are sources of reliable information; and from
them we can learn more of the propagation or dissemination of
certain diseases through the water supply, and the relation of
water to health. The cholera epidemics of Great Britain exhibit
striking examples.</p>

<p>The <ins class="corr" id="tn-13" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'testimory Dr.'">
testimony of Dr.</ins> Daniel Richmond, the medical officer of
Paisley, before the Rivers Pollution Commission of 1874, in reference
to the cholera epidemics, is of sufficient interest to be
embodied <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">verbatim</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“1. Have you any complaint to make of the water supply? No.
The water that we have in Paisley is of a very superior character, and
there is an unlimited supply to the whole of the inhabitants. The
supply is constant, and I regard that as one of the greatest blessings
the people ever received.</p>

<p>“2. Is there any water used which is obtained from wells? None.
During the last epidemic of cholera the wells were ordered to be entirely
shut up.</p>

<p>“3. When did the last epidemic of cholera occur? Four years ago.
But I should say it was not epidemic in Paisley then. It was threatened
in 1866.</p>

<p>“4. Had you any cases of cholera then? No. There was a danger
felt about it, but I had no fear of it; and I expressed that opinion
before the Sanitary Committee, that we should have no attack of
cholera, and that the city of Glasgow would not have it.</p>

<p>“5. On what did you found that opinion? Upon the unlimited
supply of pure water that we had, and on the supply of pure water
that Glasgow had obtained from Loch Katrine.</p>

<p>“6. Was your prediction fulfilled in both cases? Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>“7. When had you cholera last in Paisley? Was it in 1854? In
1854.</p>

<p>“8. Had you an attack of cholera in 1849? Yes. A very sharp
attack.</p>

<p>“9. What was the state of the water supply in 1849? In 1848
and 1849 the town was but partially supplied with water, and some
of the large suburbs, such as Charleston, were not supplied with the
town’s water. Charleston was supplied with water from wells. There
was one well that belonged to Baille Smith, which supplied a large
quadrangle of buildings; that well was at the bottom of an incline,
surmounted by buildings on all sides except one. Those wells took
a supply from the surface. They were surrounded by dung-pits, and
the wells imbibed the impurities of the dung-pits. I took occasion to
warn the people of the district not to use water from the wells, but
to get the town’s water. I recommended the authorities to open
pipes connected with the town’s water, and to supply Charleston with
pure water; and very soon after that was done the cholera disappeared
from that district. At the last threatened visitation of cholera,
in 1866, the Sanitary Committee took the precaution to remove all the
handles from the pumps, and they had the wells shut up.</p>

<p>“10. Do you think there is a direct connection between the water
supplied to a town and the propagation of cholera? I believe that
there is a very intimate connection between the use of impure water
and the propagation <ins class="corr" id="tn-14" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'of cholora; and'">
of cholera; and</ins> the proper antidote to that is a
free and unrestricted supply of pure water.”</p>

<p>In Calcutta the yearly death rates from cholera averaged
nearly 4,000 from 1841 to 1870. When water-works were introduced
the rate of deaths were:</p>

<p>The famous Broad Street pump, in London, in 1848, killed
500 persons in a single week.</p>

<p>In 1866 many deaths occurred from the use of water from a
famous pump in Brooklyn. All trouble was brought to an end
when the health officers removed the handle.</p>

<p>Typhoid fever and diarrhea are universally traced to impure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
water, and numerous examples can be given that were directly
due to this cause. The enterprising town of Rugby, on the
Cincinnati Southern Railroad, furnished us with a case of this
nature. In Millbank Prison, England, typhoid fever was especially
fatal until the year 1854, when the supply was taken from
an artesian well in Trafalgar Square, instead of the Thames;
and immediately thereafter, and up to April, 1872, a period of
eighteen years, there have been only three deaths from typhoid
fever.</p>

<p>This subject is possibly most interesting to Cincinnati, because
of its direct application to our source. River water is
next to the most suspicious of waters, and the character is the
bone of contention among scientists. Just how far and how
much sewage may be admitted, and what influences are exerted
to destroy it, are interesting discussions, part of which we have
quoted.</p>

<p>The Rivers Pollution Commission of Great Britain arrived at
the conclusion “that there is no river in the United Kingdom
long enough to effect the destruction of sewage by oxidation.”
And a direct contradiction of the statement by the eminent
physician, Dr. Letheby, medical officer to corporation of London,
“that if sewage matter be mixed with twenty times its bulk
of ordinary river water, and flow a dozen miles, there is not a
particle of that sewage to be discovered by chemical means.”</p>

<p>The experiments of this commission show “that scarcely two-thirds
of the sewage was destroyed in a flow of 168 miles, at the
rate of one mile per hour, or after the lapse of a week.”</p>

<p>Investigations of the Rivers Pollution Commission on Sewage
Pollution are as follows:</p>

<h3>REDUCTION OF SEWAGE BY AERATION.</h3>

<p>One volume of filtered London sewage mixed with nine volumes
of water, the mixture contained .267 organic carbon and
.081 organic nitrogen. After agitation and freely exposed to
the air and light every day, and being syphoned, in a slender
stream, from one vessel to another, the result, after 96 hours,
was .250 organic carbon, and .058 organic nitrogen; and, after
196 hours’ test, was .2 organic carbon, and .054 organic nitrogen.
Temperature, 20° centigrade.</p>

<p>The above results would correspond to a flow of 96 miles, at
rate of one mile per hour, with a reduction in per cent of 6.4
organic carbon, and 28.4 organic nitrogen; or a flow of 192
miles, at rate of one mile per hour, with a reduction in per cent
of 25.1 organic carbon, and 33.3 organic nitrogen.</p>

<p>Sir Benjamin Brodie, in his evidence before a former River
Pollution Commission, stated: “That it was simply impossible
that the oxidizing power acting on sewage running in mixture
with water over a distance of any length is sufficient to remove
its noxious quality; that the oxygen in the water and on its
surface does not exercise any rapidly oxidizing power on organic
matter.” He believed “that an infinitesimally small quantity
of decayed matter is able to produce an injurious effect upon
health; that if a large proportion of organic matter were removed
by oxidation, the quantity left might be sufficient to
be injurious to health. To destroy organic matter the most
powerful oxidizing agents are required. We must boil it with
nitric acid and chloric acid and the most perfect chemical agents.
To think to get rid of organic matter by exposure to the air for
a short time is absurd.”</p>

<p>Prof. Frankland, one of the Rivers Pollution Commission of
1874, says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That I should rely upon dilution quite as much and more than
upon the destruction of injurious matter; that the flow of a river has
a most natural influence in the removal of subsidence of a large proportion
of the suspended impurities both organic and mineral, <em>especially
if the flow be sluggish in places</em>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Prof. Brodie stated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There are causes operating, as we all know, to destroy the sewage
which, to a certain extent, will effect that end; but the question, as I
understand it, is, whether those causes are really adequate to destroy
the sewage, not partially but absolutely and entirely, during a given
course of the river? <em>I do not think, in the present state of our knowledge,
to pronounce an absolute opinion upon that point.</em> But if you ask
whether it is wise to drink water into which you have put sewage,
knowing that you have no means of getting that sewage out of it, that
is a question which any one can answer for himself, assuming always
the injurious character of sewage.”</p>
</div>

<p>The fifth annual report of the Board of Health of Massachusetts
(1875), contains the following, on the effects of oxidation,
dilution, and deposition:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>Oxidation.</em>&mdash;Although it is not practical, in the case of a running
stream like the Merrimack, to trace the progress of the destruction of
the organic material by oxidation, yet there is no doubt that a certain
amount is so destroyed. The presence of nitrogen in the form of nitrites
and nitrates is mainly due to the oxidation of nitrogenous organic
material. In the last report of the Board, the reasons are given
which lead to the belief that the effects of oxidation have been overrated,
although they are not, on the other hand, to be depreciated.</p>

<p>“<em>Deposition.</em>&mdash;Much waste material, thrown into rivers, is made up
wholly or in part of substances insoluble in water. A portion, and a
very considerable portion, even in a running stream is deposited upon
the bottom or stranded upon the banks. At the time of spring freshets
much that during the summer may have been deposited at one
part of the stream, in the bed or on the banks, is washed up again,
and mingling with the earthy materials, held in suspension, is swept
onward to the sea or enveloped in the earthy matter, especially if this
be of a clayey nature, is deposited lower down the stream. These
spring freshets are relied upon for cleansing banks used for infiltration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>“<em>Dilution.</em>&mdash;By far the most important reason of the apparent disappearance
of sewage and other waste material, is the fact that the
amount of solid matter is so small compared with the volume of water
into which it is thrown, that it is disseminated through the mass and
thus lost to observation, and in many cases to chemical test.</p>

<p>“Analyses of water, below and above Lawrence and Lowell, showed
no increase in chlorine. The substance can not escape from the
water in gaseous form, nor does it deposit in insoluble combination,
yet first inspection would lead to a conclusion that no real increase
existed. The facts are that the reduction was due to dilution, and not
to any destruction or decomposition. Much depends of course upon
the size of the stream into which the refuse is thrown. Thus, while
into the Merrimack at Lowell, even during the minimum summer flow
of 2,100 cubic feet per second, it would be necessary to throw more
than 100 tons of solid matter daily in order to increase the amount in
the water by one grain to the gallon; another and smaller stream might
be hopelessly fouled by a single factory.”</p>

<p>The effects of dilution are shown in the analysis of the Schuylkill
River&mdash;there being less sewage at Fairmount Dam, the nearest
to the outlet, than any point above. It is estimated that 300,000 inhabitants,
exclusive of those in Philadelphia, live within the water-shed
of this river, less than 150 miles above Philadelphia, the undiluted
sewage from these persons amounting annually to 150,000 tons. In
addition to this pollution 15,000,000 gallons daily flow from 115 establishments
located on the banks, not considering <ins class="corr" id="tn-19" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'the 57 colleries'">
the 57 collieries</ins> and 76 anthracite furnaces. Yet with all this contamination the water
at Fairmount, chemically considered, is as pure as most sources. The
chemists in their report say: “Having now shown that the Schuylkill
water is about as good a water as we might wish to find for a large
city in its mineral and organic content.</p>

<p>“Since the present water is good enough, we may keep it so, and
even improve it by a system of sewage gradually extended up both
sides of the river, especially the left bank, above the influence of
Monayunk, and by procuring sufficient legislative power to control
the escape of sewage or possibly injurious manufacturing residue.
The long line of many miles would tend greatly to the purification of
the water by aeration, deposition, or abstraction of possibly injurious
substances from the water by the time it reached within using distance
of the city.”</p>

<p>The increase of solid matter in the Schuylkill has been as

<h3>THAMES RIVER.</h3>

<p>Although the water of the Thames has been submitted to
analyses by different chemists, on many hundred occasions, no
constituent which could be pronounced noxious, has been detected;
but the history of the water traced in the inorganic constituents
above referred to, always reveals that which is, indeed,
well known to be the fact&mdash;its previous contamination with
sewage or animal matters&mdash;(Rivers Pollution Commission, 1874.)</p>

<p>The area of water-shed drainage of the Thames above pumping
station is 3,675 square miles, the minimum summer flow of
350 millions of gallons daily. There are one million persons
above the intakes of pumping works. The whole river and its
principal tributaries are under strictest sanitary regulation, which
the government is able to enforce, notwithstanding a great mass
of sewage is poured into the stream.</p>

<p>The Rivers Pollution Commission, of 1874, sum up their investigation
of the Thames and Lea Rivers as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“1st. That the river receives the sewage from a large number of
towns and other inhabited places, the washings of a large cultivated
land, and the filthy discharge from many industrial processes and
manufactures.</p>

<p>“2d. That the water is used for bathing, washing of sheep and cattle,
and dirty linen and putrid carcasses of animals float upon its surface.</p>

<p>“3d. That it is the common water way for a large amount of dangerous
polluting matter, etc.</p>

<p>“4th. That in time of flood a large proportion, both of the suspended
and dissolved filth, is conveyed down to the intakes, and in ordinary
weather considerable portion of soluble organic matter makes its way
to the pumping works, and is still present in the water distributed <em>to
the consumers</em>.</p>

<p>“5th. That the water is, nevertheless, when efficiently filtered, free
from any offensive taste or odor.</p>

<p>“6th. That, notwithstanding the application of partial remedies, for
sewage pollution, at Banbury, Eton, and Windsor, and the great care
exercised by most of the companies in the storage and filtration of the
water, the organic pollution contained in the Thames water delivered
in London, though subject to fluctuations from the greater or less
prevalence of floods, does not diminish. The proportion of organic
impurity present in Thames water, as delivered in London, was:</p>

<p>“7th. That there is no hope of this disgusting state of the river being
so far remedied as to preclude the presence of animal and other
offensive matters, even in the filtered Thames water as delivered in
the metropolis.</p>

<p>“8th. That the Thames should, therefore, as early as possible, be
abandoned as a source of water for domestic use.</p>

<p>“9th. That the temperature of the water drawn from the company’s
mains is liable to excessive fluctuations, being near the freezing point
in winter and so warm in summer as to be vapid and unpalatable.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Lea River is also condemned as a source of water supply.</p>

<p>Prof. Chandler, of New York, quotes the authority of eminent
scientists, who say the Thames, a short distance above
London, is wholesome, palatable, and agreeable, and safe for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
domestic use, notwithstanding the large amount of sewage (the
number of grains per gallon being three times that of the
Schuylkill), although controlled by strict governmental laws.</p>


<h3>QUALITY OF POLLUTION.</h3>

<p>Scientists tell us that it is not so much the quantity as the
quality of the sewage:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is true a large amount of refuse material is of such character as
to be, except in excessive quantities, of no appreciable influence on
the human system; the addition of the inorganic compounds of lime,
soda, potash, etc., would have no deleterious effect; in fact, although
the lime compounds increase the hardness of water, and make it less
desirable for washing, the presence of a moderate amount of mineral
substance makes the water more palatable and very probably more
wholesome.</p>

<p>“Then, in case of many waste liquors, which appear to be very
offensive, the matter which really could be regarded as injurious is
comparatively small in amount. If we consider the character of the
substances discharged by different manufacturing establishments, we
shall find them very different. Some of them are such as to be universally
regarded as unfit to admit to any stream; those, for instance,
containing lead, arsenic, etc.; others, such as salts of iron, are scarcely
regarded as injurious; thus, the discharge of sulphate of iron (copperas)
into a stream already polluted with sewage matter, might,
within certain limits, be of positive advantage. Again, in the case of
some of the vegetable dye-stuffs, the weak-spent dye liquors, although
they communicate a very foul appearance to the water for some distance,
yet contain a comparatively small amount of solid matter, and,
if discharged into a stream of considerable size, as soon as disseminated
through it, are diluted to a very great extent.</p>

<p>“Different in character, however, from much of the refuse of manufacturing
establishments is the sewage coming from dwellings, or the
sewage (in its more restricted sense of excremental matter from animal
sources) which comes from our manufactories. In fact, this foul
material, coming from establishments employing a large number of
operators, is likely, in many cases, to have a more injurious effect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
upon the stream into which it is thrown than refuse from the manufacturing
operations. There are, however, some branches of industry
which discharge refuse material offensive and dangerous to health.
Such material is discharged from tanneries, wool-pulling and hide-dressing
establishments, slaughter-houses and rendering-houses. ‘Too
much stress can not be laid upon the importance of preventing the
discharge of such refuse.’”&mdash;(Prof. Nichols, in Fifth Annual Report
of <ins class="corr" id="tn-23" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Massachussets State'">
Massachusetts State</ins> Board of Health.)</p>

<p>“The discharge of gas works is known to kill fish and destroy lower
forms of animal life, which are important agents in preserving the
purity of fresh water.</p>

<p>“One would not assert that the drainage of a single house would
contaminate the water of a large river like the Merrimack so as to make
it unfit for domestic use, yet we must beware how we depreciate the
effect of sewage matter, even in a large stream.”&mdash;(Prof. Nichols, in
Fifth Annual Report of Massachusetts State Board of Health, 1875.)</p>

<p>“With small amount of sewage the chances are favorable for the
action of atmospheric influences, and particles of undecomposed
material-propagating disease are rendered proportionally small, owing
to the great dilution.</p>

<p>“A minute quantity may do much harm, because it is now generally
believed, that it may hold the specific thing that propagates
specific diseases.</p>

<p>“Rice water evacuations, of a cholera patient, however much diluted,
still remains in liquid, although chemical test fails to detect it.</p>

<p>“The carcass of a dead animal, thrown into a river or pond, and
confined there, so as not to be borne off bodily, gradually wastes
away, and, in a longer or shorter time, the main part of the carcass
has disappeared. What has become of it? A part has been converted
into gaseous products of decomposition, as the offensive odors observed
during the decay will testify; but another portion has been carried
off by the stream as soluble nitrogenous organic matter. This
nitrogenous matter would be detected a short distance away, with
greater or less ease, according to the volume of water present; but in
a stream of large size, or in a lake at no very great distance from the
source of contamination, it would be impossible to discover any offensive
matter. There is a limit to the delicacy of our tests: there is a
point beyond which, at the present, we are not able to go. At the
present time, a chemical analysis alone is not sufficient to determine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
the desirability of a given water-supply.”&mdash;(Rivers Pollution Commission,
1874.)</p>

<p>“The action of a float, upon or near the surface of the water, is no
indication of the movement, back and forth, of the sewage in suspension.
Portions of fresh sewage, it is true, will float, but after maceration
the sewage has a specific gravity of about 1.325, and will sink, in
still water, or very slow currents, at the rate of one foot per minute;
but in a current of 170 feet a minute, it will not sink, but remain in
suspension.”&mdash;(J. W. Adams, C. E., Water Supply Commission of
Philadelphia, 1874.)</p>

<p>“This evidence, taken in connection with our own investigations,
appear to us, conclusively, to prove:</p>

<p>“1st. That there is, at certain times, in human excreta, some material
capable of producing disease, of a very fatal character, in human
subjects.</p>

<p>“2d. That this morbific matter can be detected only by its specific
action upon human subject, and can not be distinguished, either by
chemical or microscopical analysis, even in the concentrated excreta,
much less in water mixed with the excreta.</p>

<p>“3d. That, inasmuch as the organic matters of sewage are oxidized
and destroyed with extreme slowness in running water, there is great
probability that morbific matter will escape destruction and be conveyed
to great distances in rivers and streams.”&mdash;(Rivers Pollution
Commission, 1874.)</p>

<p>“Carbonates of calcium and lime produce temporary hardness;
while sulphate of lime and calcium and salts of magnesium produce
permanent hardness.</p>

<p>“Temporary hardness is objectionable for culinary and manufacturing
purposes, and excessive hardness is productive of disease known
as gravel. Magnesium salts are especially objectionable, because
they cause diarrhœa and dyspepsia. Goitre, or swelling of the glands
and cretinism, a kind of insanity, are charged to this impurity.</p>

<p>“Frequently, the water happens to be a little off color, especially
after a heavy storm, and the consumers get an idea that the water is
poisoned, and no amount of re-assuring will prove the reverse. Such
cases occurred in <ins class="corr" id="tn-24" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'New Yory City'">
New York City</ins>, once or twice, during the late war
with the South. A little investigation will show the absurdity of such
a thing.</p>

<p>“One-sixteenth of a grain of strychnine is necessary to poison a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
person. It would, therefore, require three and one-half tons of
strychnine to have poisoned the Croton water effectually&mdash;a quantity
not to be had in the world, and to procure it would take about three
years.</p>

<p>“If arsenic was desirable, two grains for each person would be required,
or 114 tons for the whole population of the city at that time.
Living animals, when seen under the microscope, are very formidable
in appearance and frightful in motion, yet they are not objectionable.
They only inhabit very pure water. It sometimes happens, owing,
perhaps, to some peculiarity of the season, that these little animals
multiply to such an extent as to produce serious annoyance.</p>

<p>“It is stated that one-sixth of the deaths in Iceland are caused by
little animals being taken into the system. Young leeches, contained
in drinking water, sometimes fix themselves <ins class="corr" id="tn-25" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'on the pharanx'">
on the pharynx</ins>. In Algiers, 400 French soldiers were sick at one time from this cause.”&mdash;(From
Prof. Foote’s lecture.)</p>

<h3>CONTAMINATION OF WATER SUPPLY.</h3>

<p>Boston water has become quite offensive from vegetable fermentation,
some say, although others attribute it to dead fish,
eels, and animal organisms, and, later, to a green moss. The
water tastes, at times, like cucumbers. The present trouble is
traced to the new “Sudbury” supply. The older source,
Lake Cochituate, is, however, contaminated by drainage from
the town of Natick, through Pegan Pond.</p>

<p>Croton water (New York supply) has, at times, suffered from
dead fish and decayed leaves.</p>

<p>Hartford, Yonkers, Poughkeepsie, and Albany report the presence
of <ins class="corr" id="tn-25a" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'miscroscopic plants'">
microscopic plants</ins> and animals in their water, and
these organisms indicate stagnation. “Any undue preponderance
of animal or vegetable life lead to the propagation of new
forms of life dangerous to health.”</p>

<p>Springfield (Massachusetts) water tastes, at times, like green
corn; while Cambridge is contaminated by the drainage of
meadows.</p>

<p>Mr. G. W. Carpenter, Superintendent of Albany Water-Works,
reports:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There are two distinct causes (each imparting to the water an
odor and taste peculiar to itself) that have affected our reservoirs, at
different periods, during the last few years: the one giving to the
water the odor and taste of fish, the other imparting to it a musty
odor and taste sometimes detected in dead wood. In the former, it is
extremely difficult to satisfy consumers that the impurities are not due
solely to fish in the reservoir, while in the latter they are equally
confident that the reservoirs are little less than stagnant ponds.”</p>
</div>

<p>The latter is sometimes exceedingly offensive and similar to
sulphuretted hydrogen gas. In 1875 he again reports: “That all
impounded waters in this section of the country are liable to
become impure; that while the impurities have been traced to
lower forms of animal organisms, little is known of the condition
that favor their growth; that the germs of the organism probably
come from the atmosphere.”</p>

<p>Chicago will be compelled to move her crib further into the
lake, now two miles from shore, to get beyond the limits of the
Chicago River sewage.</p>

<p>St. Louis, like Cincinnati, has outgrown its water system (established
in 1872 at a cost of five millions,) and is obliged to
drink muddy water.</p>

<p>Cleveland extended its aqueduct in 1872, 1¼ miles into the
lake in order to escape shore water.</p>

<p>Detroit, after considerable discussion, removed their source
of supply three miles above the city, and constructed new works
in preference to expending more money on the old works.</p>

<p>Rochester, N. Y., expended 4½ millions for bringing the
water of Hemlock Lake thirty miles to the city.</p>

<p>Baltimore celebrated only last October the opening of their
new aqueduct, conveying the waters of Gunpowder River 7
miles in distance, at a cost of over four millions.</p>

<p>Indianapolis has been compelled to erect new works owing to
the contamination of the present source.</p>

<span class="fs70">PURIFICATION OF WATERS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The Rivers Pollution Commission of 1874, says, as regards
filtration: “No process has yet been devised for cleaning surface
water once contaminated with sewage, so as to make it fit
for drinking.” Others say it is not safe to trust to dilution,
storage, agitation, or filtration for periods of time, for the complete
removal from water of disease-producing elements whatever
they may be.</p>

<p>Dr. Frankland states:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I believe the noxious parts in sewage is that which is held in mechanical
suspension, not held in solution. I would not say it is impossible
to remove it, but no system of filtration will secure its removal.
There are only two processes by which it can be effectually
removed&mdash;one by boiling for a long time, and the other by distillation.”</p>
</div>

<p>The methods adopted for filtration of water are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“1. Infiltration&mdash;by intercepting underground currents through natural
formations of beds or banks of water-courses.</p>

<p>“2. Filtration&mdash;mechanically by artificial beds of sand, gravel, etc.,
chemically by charcoal, iron, etc.</p>

<p>“3. Subsidence&mdash;clarification by deposition; storage reservoirs.</p>

<p>“4. Aeration&mdash;spontaneous purification by oxidation.</p>

<p>“5. Covered reservoirs&mdash;to prevent atmospheric influences.</p>

<p>“6. Precipitation of carbonates&mdash;Clark’s System.”</p>
</div>

<p>The infiltration system is resorted to where natural means for
permeation are found; the galleries for intercepting the water
being constructed in the sand or gravel banks or bed.</p>

<p>The clarification, however, is necessarily restricted, owing to
the general high rate of filtration.</p>

<p>Lowell, Mass., has a gallery in the gravel banks of the Merrimack
River, 1,300 feet in length, 8 feet by 8 feet, the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
8 feet below the river bed. The capacity is six million gallons,
and rate of flow 150 gallons per square foot in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Lawrence, Mass., has a similar gallery.</p>

<p>Brookline’s (Mass.) gallery is 762 feet in length; 6 feet below
the river bed. Rate of flow is 490 feet per square foot.</p>

<p>Newark, N. J., tried the experiment of driven wells. They
drove sixty-three-inch tubes 28 feet apart, 40 feet deep, into
the bank of the Passaic, three hundred feet from the shore line.
The tubes were attached to three lines of suction pipes, and
the latter united in one twenty-four-inch main for the supply of
their five million pump. As their expectations as to the quality
and quantity of water were not realized, a well was substituted.</p>

<p>Columbus, O., has a gallery under the Scioto River, 600 feet
in length, with a capacity of eight millions daily.</p>

<p>Toronto, Canada, has a basin excavated in an island of Lake
Huron, opposite the city, 13½ feet below low water, and 3,090
feet in length; the rate of flow is 52 imperial gallons per square
foot for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Lyons, France, has two covered galleries along the banks of
the Rhone; the area of bottoms 17,200 square feet; capacity
six millions, and rate of flow at lowest stage 100 gallons per
square foot.</p>

<p>Toulouse, France, has three covered galleries along the banks
of the Garonne River. The last gallery constructed is 1,180
feet long; capacity, two and a half millions; rate of flow, 228
gallons per square foot of bottom area.</p>

<p>Perth, Scotland, has a gallery in an island of the River Tay,
300 feet long, 4 feet wide by 8 feet high, 2½ feet below the
surface of the river; rate of flow, 182 gallons per square foot per
diem.</p>

<p>Genoa, Italy, has a gallery in the valley of the northern slope
of the Mantine Alps, 1,181 feet above the sea level. It is
1,780 feet long, 5 feet wide and 7 to 8 feet high, and extends,
in part, beneath the bed of the river Scrivia, transversely from
side to side, and in part along the bank. It has a delivery of
6,412 gallons for twenty-four hours per lineal foot.</p>

<p>The city of Glasgow made two failures in attempting to furnish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
a supply by this system. The first experiment was the
construction of a reservoir on the northern bank of the Clyde,
below the level of the river. Beneath the bottom of the reservoir
was thirty-two-feet cylindrical tunnels made of wedged-shape
bricks without mortar. The failure was due to the inability
to keep the interstices free from the deposit of impurities.
In the second plan, they excavated shallow wells, 10 feet in diameter,
6 feet deep, and 20 feet apart, in the stratum of sand
adjacent to the river. The wells were connected by pipes. The
scheme was a worse failure than the first one.</p>

<p>It often happens, as in the case of Waltham, Massachusetts,
in locating these galleries, that spring water is intercepted in
place of the desired water of the flowing stream. The difference
in temperature and increased hardness of the spring water, determine
the class of water.</p>


<h3>FILTRATION</h3>

<p class="noindent">is the artificial method of clarification by mechanical and chemical
means. By the mechanical system heavier impurities are
held in suspense by percolation of water through carefully prepared
beds of sand, gravel, coke, shells, and like substances.</p>

<p>The total area of the London filter beds in 1874 was 68 acres,
and rate of filtration per hour in inches and depth of water, or
head on beds, were:</p>

<p>The efficiency of filtration is inversely to rate of flow. Humber
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is now generally admitted that filtration through sand, to be
effective, should not proceed at a higher rate than 6 inches of descent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
per hour; or, in other words, there should be at least 1½ square yards
of filtering area for each 1,000 gallons per day. This is, of course,
exclusive of reserve area, which will be necessary to permit of at
least one bed being cleansed while sufficient area remains in operation
in the other beds.”</p>
</div>

<p>The maintenance of these beds enhance the cost of supplying
water, because they must be cleansed frequently&mdash;in some cases
once a week. The regulation and control of the water consumption
is an important consideration, that the rate of increase will
be proportioned to the growth of the city; and not, as in this
country, an unaccountable rapid increase due to the profligate
use of water that makes filtration impossible. Over eleven-twelfths
of the water supplied to London is filtered with the following
efficiency:</p>

one litre of water.</p>

<p>3. Dr. Bischoff’s (Jr.) process of removing organic matter by spongy
iron, prepared by heating hydrated oxide of iron with carbon.</p>

<p>4. Spencer’s process of sand filtration with crushed grains of a carbide

removal.</p>

<p>5. Sheet-iron strips placed in water decomposes organic matter
rapidly. It is recommended by eminent authority.</p>

<p>6. Charcoal is, possibly, the best substance for removing organisms
chemically; but its efficiency is destroyed by an insoluble precipitate
of either lime or iron. Messrs. Adkins &amp; Co., of London, have
patented a method to overcome this objection, by use of charcoal
plates that may be easily scraped.</p>

<h3>SUBSIDENCE</h3>

<p class="noindent">is the most popular method of clarification of water by the deposition
of heavy matter, accomplished in large storage reservoirs.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If the reservoir be very small and shallow, and containing not more
than a day’s supply, for example, it is plain there can be but little
opportunity for subsidence; but even in such cases, if the reservoir be
kept full, or nearly full, the floating impurities might never enter the
circulation. In the case of a large reservoir, holding many days’ supply,
it is quite different. Time is then afforded for the heavier impurities
to settle to the bottom; and, if the water is admitted at one
end and taken out at the other end of the reservoir, very little, if any,
of the heavier particles can pass into the circulation; and we can see
no reason why any of the superficial impurities, such as remain on or
near the surface, should ever be allowed to enter the circulation.”&mdash;(From
Water Supply Commission of Engineers, Philadelphia, 1875.)</p>
</div>

<p>Fanning says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Subsidence does not completely clarify the water even in a fortnight
or three weeks’ time.”</p>
</div>

<p>London has 262 acres of subsiding reservoirs for removing
the turbidity of the Thames and Lea Rivers, and used as storage
at times of sudden freshets.</p>

<p>Mere exposure to the air, even if accompanied by violent agitation,
is comparatively powerless for the removal of polluting
organic matter from water. Although, however, the flow of a
river has thus but little effect in purifying the water by the
oxidation of the dissolved organic matters, it has a most material
influence in the removal by subsidence of a large proportion
of the suspended impurities both organic and mineral, especially
if the flow be sluggish in places.</p>

<p>In passing through still pools, the turbid streams let fall its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
load of grosser mechanically suspended particles, and thus
the water becomes clearer, although the dissolved impurity remains
nearly as great as ever. It is, doubtless, this clarification
by subsidence which has led to the very general but erroneous
belief in the rapid self-purifying power of running water.</p>

<h3>AERATION</h3>

<p>is the destruction of animate life by oxidation, and is best accomplished
by placing weirs across streams, sheet flashing, or
spreading of water in thin sheets, or by roughness of beds or
banks of running waters. The benefits may be ascertained,
chemically, by the presence of nitrates and nitrites. The Water
Supply Commission of Engineers, for the investigation of the
water system of Philadelphia, say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This is one of nature’s processes for purifying water, not only
of the land, but of the ocean, and bodies of water deprived of it,
other processes are apt to set in. It is, therefore, desirable that nothing
should be done to obstruct this beneficial action. We have been
informed that the cutting of ice, which was formerly allowed on the
Fairmount pool, has been prohibited or discontinued. We would
especially recommend that the cutting of ice on the pool be resumed,
as an important sanitary measure, on account of the aeration it will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
afford. If this were done systematically, it might remedy, at least to
some extent, the disagreeable odor which we learn is sometimes
noticed during the winter.”</p>
</div>

<p>The aeration adopted by Mr. Moore, Supt. of Cincinnati
Water Works, at Eden reservoir, improved the purity of the
water twenty per cent., as shown by the analysis of Prof. Stuntz,
who recommends the adoption of the process on a larger scale.</p>

<p><em>Covered Reservoirs</em>, although used by the ancients, are now
being recommended as highly beneficial to the purity of the
water, by depriving the organic germs of their propagation elements
of light and heat of the sun, preventing freezing of water,
and reducing evaporation to a minimum. Paris has two such
structures. Chelsea (London) Water-Works has one of ten million
capacity that cost $110,000.00.</p>

<p>The temporary hardness of water is produced by absorption
of carbonates, and may be reduced to softness by:</p>

<td class="tdl">Carbonate of soda,</td>

<td class="tdl">Caustic lime.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Permanent hardness is produced by sulphates, chlorides and
nitrates of lime, and magnesia, and can not be dissipated by
boiling.</p>

<p>An imperial gallon of pure water can take up but about two
grains of carbonate of lime, but the presence of carbonic acid in
the water will enable the same 70,000 grains (an imperial gallon)
to take up twelve, sixteen, twenty, or more grains of the
carbonate, and for each grain so taken up is one degree of
hardness by the Clarke scale.</p>

<p>The system patented by Dr. Clarke, of England, in 1856, is
the most practical method for the precipitation of lime, effected
by means of a dilution of water with slaked lime, in the proportion
of one of lime-water to ten of hard water. The system is in
use in several small places in England, notably Canterbury, where
100,000 gallons are reduced, daily, at a cost of twenty-seven shillings
per million gallons, with the following results:</p>

<p>Plumstead water-works, previous to its purchase by the Kent
Water Company, of London, reduced, daily, 1,000,000 gallons
by the Clarke method. The new owners, however, abandoned
it.</p>

<p>From the testimony of a number of reputable physicians, before
the Rivers Pollution Commission, of 1874, hard water, to
a limited extent, ten degrees, was not considered injurious, and,
by some, absolutely beneficial to health, although soft water,
for a general water supply, was preferable.</p>

<p>Mr. Homersham, C. E., the designer of several of these
works, testified, before this commission, that it cost £1, 7s. for
precipitating 1,000,000 gallons. To introduce this system into
London, with a consumption of 100,000,000 daily, the cost, he
says, would be $3,000,000 for plant, and requiring over thirty-three
acres of ground for basins, etc.</p>

<p>The celebrated engineer, Mr. Bateman, of England, estimates
the saving to Glasgow, by soft water, at $180,000 per annum;
and if London used the same character of water, the equivalent
would be $2,000,000 annually.</p>

<p>The use of lime, by private consumers, is recommended by
the trustees of the water department of Columbus, O. They
say that one ounce of lime, when added to thirty-six gallons of
water, make it superior, for washing purposes, to the rain-water
usually obtained from the cistern.</p>

<h3>SPRINGS AND WELLS.</h3>

<p>We have, under this name, nature’s resources for supplying
our wants, whose facilities for furnishing the requisite supply
depend upon the local rain-fall, configuration of the land, and
the nature, or geological formation, of surface and subsoils.</p>

<p>Land springs are fed by rain-water, gravitating through loose
permeable soils. The waters are very readily affected by infiltration
of surrounding soils, and their course so easily changed
in any direction that the permanence of such a source can not
be relied upon.</p>

<p>Deep springs are fed by the waters falling upon and soaking
down to great depths, and find their way to the surface through
some fault, upheaval or other great geological disturbance, or
between some impermeable strata. The most copious springs are
in the tertiary strata, and the law, as regards their abundance,
is “the rarer the visible springs may be, the more copious they
would be found.” The permanence of the springs can only be
relied upon after careful gauging, extending over several years.</p>

<p>Wells may be separated under the following divisions:</p>

<p class="noindent pad10 fs80">
Shallow, or dug wells.<br />
Ordinary deep, or pump wells.<br />
Artesian wells.<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Shallow and deep wells are those which are sunk <ins class="corr" id="tn-36" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'through  permeable'">
through a permeable</ins> stratum, and form, as it were, reservoirs, into <ins class="corr" id="tn-36a" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'which  land'">
which the land</ins> springs may filter and accumulate; whilst artesian <ins class="corr" id="tn-36b" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'wells are  which'">
wells are those which</ins><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
are sunk through an impervious upper stratum, to reach a subterranean
water-bearing stratum lying, in its turn, upon an impervious
upholding bed. In the former cases, the quantity of water obtainable
is simply that which can filter through the sides of the well
to replace the water removed, or which may accumulate in any reservoir
formed below; whilst, in the latter case, the quantity obtainable
will depend simply upon the power of the water-bearing stratum to
transmit water.</p>

<p>“In the case of deep-seated wells, the probable yield of water
must depend, primarily, upon the area of permeable strata likely to
affect the supply, and upon the facilities those strata may offer for the
passage of water; and, secondly, upon the rate of consumption which
takes place in the neighborhood, for the quantity of water which any
particular stratum can supply is only a limited quantity; so that, evidently,
if the water be taken at one point, no more will remain for
the other.”&mdash;(Hydraulic Engineering, Weale’s Series.)</p>
</div>

<p>The above fact is illustrated, practically, in London, where
the water line of the chalk formation has been permanently lowered
to the extent of fifty or sixty feet below Trinity high-water
mark; and it is even stated that the level of the water in the
wells, near the summit of this formation, rises, on the Monday
morning, in consequence of the cessation of pumping in London
during the Sundays. The experience of Liverpool corroborates
this fact: that the Windsor well, having a depth of 210 feet,
affected the surrounding wells to a maximum distance of a mile
and three quarters. The celebrated engineer and originator of
the well system of Liverpool, Robert Stephenson, from long
experience and careful observation, offered the following conclusions
(from Hughes water-works):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That an abundance of water is stored up in the new red sandstone,
and may be obtained, by sinking shafts and driving tunnels,
about the level of low water.</p>

<p>“That the sandstone is generally very pervious, admitting of deep
wells drawing their supply from distances exceeding one mile.</p>

<p>“That the permeability of the sandstone is occasionally interfered
with by faults or fissures filled with argillaceous matter, sometimes
rendering them partially, or wholly, water-tight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>“That neither by sinking, tunneling, nor boring, can the yield of
any well be very materially and permanently increased, except so far
as the contributing area may be thereby enlarged.</p>

<p>“That the contributing area to any given well is limited by the
amount of friction experienced by the movement of the water through
the fissures and pores of the sandstone; and</p>

<p>“That there is little or no probability of obtaining, permanently,
more than about 1,000,000 or 1,200,000 gallons a day from each
well, and this only when not interfered with by other deep wells.”</p>
</div>

<p>Statistics of the flow of the Windsor well show that the yield,
in 1843, was 1,152,000 gallons per day; in May, 1848, 807,061
gallons; in January, 1850, from 705,667 to 634,752 gallons.
The observations of the Green Lane well, in the same city,
give the decrease in flow, per annum, at 4.7 to 6 per cent.</p>

<p>A plan has been proposed, by Mr. Bailey Denton, that, in
order to increase the water-bearing stratum under London,
sufficiently for a water supply, and also secure the well-known
benefits of the filtration powers of the chalk, to let the Thames
water pass down to the chalk, through the London clay, by
means of wells sunk or bored. The objections raised against
this plan is the possibility of the wells becoming choked by
accumulation of impurities.</p>

<p>Mr. J. T. Fanning in his valuable “Treatise on Water Supply
Engineering,” says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The success of wells, penetrating deep into large subterranean basins,
upon the first completion, has usually led to their duplication at
other points within the same basin, and the flow of the first has often
been materially checked upon the commencement of flow in the second,
and both again upon the commencement of flow in a third,
though neither was within one mile of either of the others. The flow
of the famous well at Grenelle was seriously checked by the opening
of another well at more than three thousand yards, or nearly two miles
distant.”</p>
</div>


<h3>POLLUTION OF WELL WATER.</h3>

<p>It is stated that about fifteen millions of the British population
live in towns and urban districts. Even if we assume,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
which is not yet the case, that all these people are supplied by
water-works, the remaining twelve millions of county population
derive their water almost exclusively from shallow wells,
and these are, so far as our experience extends, almost always
horribly polluted by sewage and by animal matter of the most
disgusting origin.</p>

<p>As the contents of the water-hole or well are pumped out,
they are immediately replenished from the surrounding disgusting
mixture, and it is not therefore very surprising to be assured
that such wells do not become dry even in summer.
Unfortunately, excrementitious liquids, especially after they
have soaked through a few feet of porous soil, do not impair
the palatability of water; and this polluted liquid is consumed
from year to year without a suspicion of its character.</p>

<p>Our acquaintance with a very large portion of this class of
potable waters, has been in consequence of the occurrence of
severe outbreaks of typhoid fever amongst consumers of this
character of water.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The samples of water from deep unpolluted wells were obtained
from wells or bore-holes of a depth rarely less than 100 feet, and reaching
in one case 1,285 feet. In many cases these wells were partly or
wholly supplied by surface-polluted water. Such water, when it penetrates
only to shallow wells still retains a considerable proportion of
its polluting organic matter in an unoxidized condition: but when it
descends through one hundred feet or upwards of porous soil or rock,
the exhausted filtration to which it has been subjected in passing downwards
through so great a thickness of material, and the rapid oxidation
of the dissolved organic matters in a porous and aerated medium,
afford a considerable guarantee that all noxious constituents have been
removed.”&mdash;(Rivers Pollution Commission, 1874.)</p>

<p>“Deep wells may become polluted, either by admission of soakage
from the superficial strata into the shaft of the well, or by access
of polluted water through open fissures in the rock in which the well
is sunk.”&mdash;(Rivers Pollution Commission, 1874.)</p>

<p>“Even where wells are sunk to great distance (one was sunk at
Bondy, near Paris, to a depth of 247 feet), the surrounding soil is
not free from danger of pollution by the soaking of the foul liquid into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
the side of the well.”&mdash;(Fifth report Massachusetts State Board of
Health.)</p>

<h3>ARTESIAN WELLS.</h3>

<p>Artesian is the name applied to water-springs rising above
the surface of the ground by natural hydrostatic pressure, or boring
a small hole down through a series of strata to a water-bearing
bed inclosed between two layers. It was first practiced
in 1100, in province of Artois, France, whence it derives
its name.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The second and tertiary geological formations, such as those underneath
London and Paris, often present the appearance of immense
basins; the boundary or rim of the basin having been formed by an
upheaval of the subjacent strata. In these formations it often happens
that a porous stratum, consisting of sand, sandstone, chalk, and other
calcareous matter, is included between two impermeable layers of
clay, so as to form a flat, porous ‘U’ tube, continuous from side to
side of the valley, the outcrop on the surrounding hills forming the
mouth of the tube. The rain filtering down the porous layer to the
bottom of the basin, forms there a subterranean pore, which, with the
liquid or semi-liquid column pressing upon it, constitutes a sort of
huge natural hydrostatic bellows; sometimes the pressure on the superincumbent
crust is so great as to cause an upheaval or disturbance
of the valley, and there can be little doubt that many earthquakes
that are manifestly not of volcanic origin, are due to this simple cause.”&mdash;(Ninth
edition Encyclopedia Britannica.)</p>

<p>“An overflow results only when the surface that supplies the water-bearing
stratum is at an elevation superior to the surface of the ground
where the well is located, and the water-bearing stratum is confined
between <ins class="corr" id="tn-40" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'imperrious strata'">
impervious strata</ins>. In such cases the hydrostatic pressure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
from the higher source forces the water up to the mouth of the bore.”&mdash;(Fanning
Water Supply.)</p>

<p>“In the tertiary formations the porous layers are not so thick as in
the secondary, and, consequently, the occurrence of underground lakes
is not on so grand a scale; but there being more frequent attenuation
of these sandy beds, we find a greater number of them, and often a
series of natural fountains may be obtained in the same valley preceding
from water-bearing strata at different depths, and rising to different
heights.</p>

<p>“It does not follow that all the essentials for an Artesian well are
present, though two impermeable strata, with a porous one between,
may crop out around a basin. There must be, in the first place, continuity
of the permeable bed for the uninterrupted passage of the
water, and there must be, on the other hand, no flaw or breach in
either of the confining layers by which the water might escape. To
one or the other of the causes is due the failure of many attempts to
find Artesian wells, where, from appearances, they might be expected.
It has occasionally happened that on deepening the bore, with the
hope of increasing the flow of water, it has ceased altogether, doubtless
from the lower confining layer being pierced, and the water allowed
to escape by another outlet.</p>

<p>“The subterranean bore is frequently of small extent, and of the
nature of a channel rather than of a broad sheet of water; and the existence
of one spring is no guarantee that another will be found by
merely boring to the same depth in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>“The preliminary theoretical determination of the existence of
these Artesian conditions is in itself a difficult matter, and can
be arrived at only by a thorough acquaintance with the geological
disposition of the district.”&mdash;(Ninth edition Encyclopedia
Britannica.)</p>

<p>“The question of a supply of water from deep wells, made by boring,
and commonly called artesian, has been somewhat discussed in
Philadelphia, but there is no probability that an adequate supply, for
the general use of the city could be obtained in that manner; and the
quality of the water obtained from such wells varies very much in different
localities, depending upon the nature of the strata from which the
water is procured, and this Commission can not recommend any dependence
upon such plans for the general city supply, attended, as
they are, with great expense and extreme uncertainty, and being, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
every case, more or less experimental.”&mdash;(Philadelphia Water Supply
Commission of Engineers, 1875.)</p>
</div>

<p>The flowing water of the Kissingen spring, Bavaria, is produced
by carbonic acid gas.</p>


<h3>TEMPERATURE OF WELLS.</h3>

<p>Invariably the temperature of water from great depths is
higher than at the surface, this being due to some unknown
source of heat in the interior of the globe.</p>

<p>In Scotland, the rate of increase of temperature, after permanent
degree has been attained, is about one degree Fahrenheit
for every forty-eight feet of descent.</p>

<p>At Grenelle, the temperature was found to be 1.8 degrees for
every 106 feet of descent below the point of constant temperature.</p>

<p>The average rate of increase of temperature is one degree
for a descent of from forty to fifty feet.</p>

<p>The temperature of the boring at Columbus increased, below
the permanent line, one degree in every seventy-one feet.</p>


<h3>EXAMPLES OF ARTESIAN WELLS.</h3>

<p>The famous well at Grenelle, France, was commenced, by
the government, in 1834, and after repeated failures and discouragements
almost to abandonment, notwithstanding the urgent
representations of the scientist Arago, that water would be
found, the end was accomplished at the depth of 1,798 feet, in the
year 1843. The diameter of the bore is 3½ inches; capacity,
600 gallons per minute; temperature of water, 82 degrees;
height of flow, 128 feet. The expense attending this boring
was 300,000 francs. The Passy well, near Paris, supplied
from the same water-bearing stratum of the Grenelle, is 1,923
feet deep; 2′ 4″ inches bore at bottom; capacity, 5,582,000
gallons per day; height of flow, 54 feet. The La Chapelle
well was started in 1866, with a gigantic bore of five feet seven
inches, and by November, 1869, had reached a depth of 1,811<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
feet, the intention of the engineer being <ins class="corr" id="tn-43" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'to exend it to'">
to extend it to</ins> a depth of 2,950 feet.</p>

<p>At the part of Paris named Butte-aux-Caelles, a well was
started, in 1866, of six and a half feet diameter, to be carried
down to a depth of 2,600 to 2,900 feet.</p>

<p>The Kent Water-Works, of London, is supplied by wells in
the chalk formation, yielding 9,000,000 gallons daily. This
great flow is due to what is known as a fault in the London
basin strata.</p>

<p>St. Louis has a well 3,147 feet deep.</p>

<p>Louisville has a three-inch well, 2,086 feet deep, with a capacity
same as the Grenelle well.</p>

<p>There have been nine artesian wells successfully bored in
Cincinnati, a description of which will be found on <a href="#Page_107">page 107</a>.</p>

<p>Charleston, South Carolina, has an artesian well 1,970 feet
deep, from which pure soft water, of 90° temperature, flows
ninety feet above the surface. It has five inch tubing on top
and two and three-fourths inch diameter at bottom. The cost
was $2,500.00, and the time required in sinking was a little
more than a year. There is also an artesian well, in the same
city, 1,250 feet deep, which discharges 25,000 gallons a day,
of water, at a temperature of eighty-eight degrees, strongly impregnated
with sodium and magnesium.</p>

<p>The desert of Sahara has a number of well borings, some
yielding as high as 1,500,000 gallons daily. The depth varies
from 130 to 400 feet, and temperature 70 to 77 degrees.</p>

<p>The Ohio State authorities undertook to supply the capital
by an artesian well. After two failures, in attempting to tube
out the quicksand, they succeeded (in November, 1857) in
piercing through the rock, and at a depth of 149 feet a vein
of water was struck that continued to wash away the borings
for nearly 100 feet below. On the 1st of October, 1870, a
depth of 2,775 feet was reached, but no flowing water obtained,
when the undertaking was abandoned for want of an appropriation.</p>

<h3>WELL BORING.</h3>

<p>The art of boring into the earth was practiced by the Chinese
2,000 years ago, the feature of their system being the percussive
action of a tool suspended by a flexible rope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>The system now practiced in Great Britain, and on the Continent,
is that in which the tools are attached to rods, consisting
of a number of lengths, from ten to thirty feet long, joined by a
separate collar, with a combined vertical and definite rotary
motion, produced by a swivel joint in the upper length, or by
suspending the rod to a “dog.” An ordinary well is first sunk
to such a depth that the water below will rise, through the boring,
into it. The object is to partly facilitate the object of boring,
but chiefly to enable the pumps to be fixed without too
great a length of suction. In deep wells, windlasses, driven by
steam power, are used for operating the tool; the size of rod
being, usually, 1¼ inch square; but for an eight foot boring,
a 4½ inch square rod was used. To <ins class="corr" id="tn-45" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'reduce the jaring'">
reduce the jarring</ins> and vibration,
where borings are of considerable depth, the rods are
hollow, in order to give same rigidity and resistance to torsion
with less weight, and made buoyant, when working in water,
by filling the rod with cork or light wood. A sliding joint,
known as the “Oëuyenhausen joint,” is frequently used to
bring the jarring only on that portion of the boring rod below.
A shell pump is employed, in combination with the boring tool,
for gathering the detritus, which obviates frequent raising of
rod. Free-falling tools, guided by sliding joint, with catch or
pall to raise same, are largely used. The weight of tool depends
upon the depth and character of boring, that of the
La Chapelle well being four tons.</p>

<p>In the oil-well boring of Pennsylvania, the rope (with about
50 feet of iron bar, sliding jaws, sinking bar, flat drill and sand
pump attached) are exclusively preferred.</p>


<h3>PRACTICAL EXAMPLES OF WELLS AS SOURCES OF SUPPLY ONLY.</h3>

<p>Where the surface soil and underlying drift possess sufficient
porous qualities for absorption of a large portion of the
rain-fall, together with the natural benefits of the impervious
stratum beneath, having a proper axis of inclination favorable
for conducting the infiltration of adjoining water-sheds, a large
supply of water may be secured by the construction of dug wells
for intercepting the subterraneous water.</p>

<p>Fanning has computed the following available quantities,
under favorable circumstances, for percolation, from one square
mile of porous gathering area (the mean annual rain being assumed
at forty inches depth).</p>

<p>The city of Brooklyn gathers its supply by intercepting
ponds. The source is the southern slope of Long Island, with
a drainage area of 60.25 square miles. The plain is composed
of fine sand, which is saturated with excellent water, the surface
of which rises twelve feet per mile from the tide level at the
shore, and which appears at the surface of the ground in springs
and streams, where depressions occur in the ground level.
The minimum observed flow occurred in 1880, and was equal
to 9.4 inches on the water-shed. The available supply is, at
times, quite small.</p>

<p>The city of Lynn uses a driven well partly, of which they
say, in their annual report for 1880:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The doubtful character of any underground supply of water,
especially when it is drawn from beneath a territory occupied by a
densely settled community, makes frequent examination of its quality
a duty not to be disregarded. We invite attention, however, to
the fact that the chemical examination of the well water has shown
an increasing quantity of foreign matter mingling with it as pumping
proceeded, and that this increase suggests an inflow of water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
to the wells from some other source than that from which it was at
first drawn.”</p>
</div>

<p>This method of securing water, however, is largely resorted
to in the origin of water-works for small cities.</p>

<p>The Sanitary Engineer (Vol. v, No. 5) refers to a proposed
well for Lincoln, Nebraska, a town of 15,000 inhabitants, that
the contractor proposed to dig for the sum of $10,000. The
estimated capacity will be ten million gallons a day, and the
editor of the paper observes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If a large well is sunk in a very saturated and porous soil, it will
probably furnish the amount required for the city (one million gallons)
at first, possibly a great deal more. But in five years’ time it is not
hazardous to predict that such a well will not yield enough water for
Lincoln. As for furnishing ten million gallons a day for any length
of time, there is no well in the world, which we know of, of such a
capacity, and all experience is against the probability of such an one
being discovered.”</p>
</div>


<h3>GRAVITATION</h3>

<p class="noindent">is that system of supply where the rain-water drainage of
elevated water-sheds is gathered in natural or artificial storage
basins, and conveyed through conduits by gravitation to the
point of supply. The important points entering into the consideration
of this method are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Character of water; present and future contamination.</p>

<p>2. Water-shed; present and future requirements for quantity and
availability, with proper knowledge of the geology of the surrounding
country.</p>

<p>3. Rain-fall, absorption and evaporation.</p>

<p>4. Elevation and distance of source.</p>

<p>5. Route of conduit.</p>

<p>6. Cost of construction.</p>
</div>

<p>The practical objections to the system are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Contamination of source by surface drainage of cultivated lands;
pollution of feeding streams, or growth of vegetation.</p>

<p>2. Necessity for large impounding reservoirs for storage of water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
during rainy seasons, requiring immense puddled walls, whose stability
is questioned.</p>

<p>3. The uncertainty of dependence on the requisite rain-fall, and
liability of short supply, or a possibility of water-famine.</p>

<p>4. The large expenditure at the outstart for construction of supply
that must be ample for future demands.</p>
</div>

<p>Surface waters from calcareous cultivated lands are polluted
with but a moderate amount of organic matter; but, as some
of this matter is almost always of animal origin, they are always
undesirable, and may at any time become dangerous for domestic
use.</p>

<p>If necessity compels their use, great care ought to be taken
to secure their efficient filtration before they are delivered to
consumers. This affords some, though by no means complete,
protection from the propagation of zymotic disease through the
agency of such waters.</p>

<p>They are generally very hard, and, unless artificially softened,
occasion a great waste of soap when used for washing. Of all
the waters of this description, those which flow from the surface,
or from the drains of sewage farms, are generally most impure,
because the time during which the foul sewage is exposed to
the purifying action of plant and soil is reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>Surface water from non-calcareous soil is generally soft but usually
turbid and subject to animal contamination. Such water
should always be carefully filtered.</p>

<p class="p1">Much depends upon the knowledge of the climatic influences
and rain-fall, extended, as it should be, through years of observation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
in determining the available quantity of water. Engineers,
however, are liable to be too sanguine of the resources
from water-sheds, by assuming, as a general rule, the average,
rather than the minimum, rain-fall.</p>

<p>In 1868 nearly all the cities and towns of England, supplied
by gravitation, suffered a water-famine, because of the overestimate
of the available rain-fall, and in an insufficient provision
of storage for an unusually long drought. Although the
rain-fall for the year was above the average, yet it was unequally
distributed.</p>

<p>The authorities of Manchester were obliged to publish official
notices cautioning the inhabitants against waste, and, on the 3d
of August, limited the supply to the city to twelve hours of the
day, stopped the street watering, and diminished the trade supplies
by one-half. In the middle of September the general
supply of the town was further limited to eight hours per day.
Many persons were prosecuted for waste or undue use of water.</p>

<p>Liverpool, Sheffield, Bristol, and several other large cities
were obliged to resort to like severe methods enforced at Manchester.
New York has been using every gallon that the aqueduct
is capable of supplying; and, during the drought of last
summer, when the head of water at Croton Lake was diminished,
the capacity of the aqueduct was so reduced that the
flow of water to the city was reduced, and a water-famine averted
only by a Providential rain-fall.</p>

<p>The rule observed among engineers, in Great Britain, in determining
the calculated rain-fall, is the deduction of one-sixth
from the average rain-fall of twenty years for an average annual
rain-fall of the three driest consecutive years in that period.
But, as Mr. Homersham, C. E., observes, the axiom in mechanics,
that the strength of a beam is the strength only of its
weakest parts, applies also to gravitation water-works, their
real strength or power of supply being only the minimum quantity
they may be reduced to.</p>

<p>Allowance for absorption depends upon the geological formation
and stratification, and for evaporation, upon local influences.</p>

<p>The following is taken from Hughes’ Water-Works:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A flat, low-lying country is seldom well adapted for the impounding
of water by embanking across the valleys. In such a district,
long and shallow embankments would be required, and these would
cause the water to spread out over a great area with a very shallow
depth. Under these circumstances, the water is apt to vegetate and
become highly impure. Again, in low-lying districts of flat countries
the rain-fall is seldom nearly so great as in upland districts, so that
much larger drainage areas must be sought.”</p>
</div>

<p>In addition to the general configuration of the valleys, which
ought to be deep and with precipitous sides, flanked by lofty
hills, there are several other points which require attentive examination
in projects for collecting water from drainage areas:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The area of water-shed.</p>

<p>2. The geological character of the soil as affecting its capacity to
absorb rain, and to allow the infiltration of water through it.</p>

<p>3. The character of the surface soil as affording soluble ingredients
which may be taken up by the water and serve to contaminate its
quality. In this point of view, districts of decomposing peat, districts
of arable agricultural land richly manured, and places thickly covered
with population, are often highly objectionable.</p>

<p>4. The rain-fall of the district, and especially the minimum fall in
any one year.</p>

<p>5. The nature of the surface-soil as affording facilities for procuring
puddle and constructing retentive reservoirs.</p>

<p>6. The consideration of compensation to mill-owners and possibly
to land-owners where the water is used for irrigation.</p>
</div>

<p>The geological structure is extremely important in estimating
the capacity of a drainage area. It is not alone the rain which
falls on the sloping surface of the hills, and finds its way by
gravitation to the lower levels; but the effect of springs is also
very great in augmenting the quantity of water. Many drainage
areas are also valleys of elevation, in which the strata dip
in opposite or anticlinal directions on opposite sides of the valley.
In this case it is evident that much of the rain falling on
a porous surface will insinuate itself between the partings of the
strata, and flow off in a direction contrary to that of the surface
drainage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>From Mr. Beardmore’s work we take the following, as the
proportion or percentage of rain-fall which flows off the surface:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“From twenty examples we have 89 as the largest per centage, the
lowest 29 per cent., and the average 64 per cent.</p>

<p>“The Eaton Brook water-shed, in Madison County, New York, of
6,800 acres, with steep slope and compact soil, underlaid by hard
greywacke rock, elevated 1,350 feet above the sea, availed 66 per
cent. of the rain-fall as surface flow.</p>

<p>“A similar water-shed, Madison Brook, gave 50 per cent. Experiments
by Wm. McAlpine, for Albany water-works, shows that from
a water-shed of 2,600 acres, 41½ per cent. of the rain-fall was carried
off by the streams from May till October, inclusive, while from November
till April, 77.6 per cent. was so carried off.”</p>
</div>

<p>In England the allowance for absorption and evaporation
ranges from nine to nineteen inches per annum. In this country
it is from 75 to 100 per cent. greater.</p>

<p>We produce from “Fanning’s Water Supply” the following
table of experiments on evaporation from surfaces of shallow
tanks:</p>

<h3>AQUEDUCTS.</h3>

<p>The plan, as adopted by Mr. Hawskley at Liverpool, and Mr.
Bateman at Glasgow, of subterranean pipes, is now universally
followed by engineers. And there is no longer any excuse for
incurring the outlay which must attend the erection of monumental
structures, such as were necessary in the times of the
ancient Romans.</p>

<p>The engineer of Marseilles Conduit adopted the “Pont du
Gard” plan for conducting the waters of the Durance, in preference
to iron pipes, and constructed the splendid folly, “as
Humber terms it,” of the aqueduct “Roquefavour.” The dimensions
are:</p>

<div class="fs80 pad6">
Length, 1,289 feet.<br />
Height, 266 feet.<br />
1st tier of 12 arches each 49½ feet span.<br />
2d tier of 15 arches each 52½ feet span.<br />
Upper tier of 54 arches each 16½ feet span.<br />
</div>

<p>The cost was $750,000, while inverted syphon pipes could
have been laid for one-third of this sum.</p>

<p><em>The aqueduct for Glasgow</em> is thirteen miles in tunnels, 3¾
miles of iron-piping across valleys, and nine miles of opening
cutting and bridges. There are eighty distinct tunnels, and
twenty-five important iron and masonry aqueducts. On the
line is the Drymen bridge on masonry piers, eighteen feet apart,
with two pipes surrounded by wood lagging, a forty-eight-inch
syphon at Aberfoyle Road, and a lofty bridge at Ballewan,
seventy feet in height.</p>

<p><em>The Aberdeen water-works</em> has a thirty-six-inch syphon, 1,200
feet in length, across Cullen Burn, supported by granite piers.</p>

<p>The Croton aqueduct is a masonry channel lined with brick.
The bottom is an inverted arch with cord 6.75 feet, and versed
sine 0.75 feet; side walls are 4 feet high, and battered so that
at the top they are 7′ 4″ apart, and surmounted with a semi-circular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
arch. The interior is 8.64 feet high, and area 53.34
square feet.</p>

<p>The grade is 0.021 feet per 100 feet, total length 38
miles. It crosses the Manhattan Valley 2 miles in extent, with
two 36-inch, one 48, and one 60-inch cast-iron pipes, and over
the Harlem River by granite bridge, known as High bridge,
100 feet above high water, composed of seven 50-feet and eight
80-feet spans. The conduit over the bridge consists of two
36-inch cast-iron pipes, and a wrought pipe 7 feet 6½ inches in
diameter, resting upon saddles, supported by cast-iron standards
placed 12 feet apart between the 36-inch pipes.</p>

<p><em>The aqueduct over Cabin John Creek</em>, of Washington, D. C.,
water supply, consists of a single arch of masonry 220 feet span,
is the largest masonry arch in the world. The rise is 57 feet 7
inches, thickness of crown 4 feet 2 inches, and at spring 6 feet
2 inches. Water is conveyed in an iron pipe 9 feet in diameter,
built in solid masonry.</p>

<p>The bridge over Georgetown Creek, on line of Washington
Conduit, is 200 feet span with two cords of iron pipe 4 feet in
diameter, 1½ inches thickness, used as water conductors. The
pipes were first lined with staves of resinous pine 3 inches thick
to prevent freezing, but have been taken out. No allowance is
made for expansion or contraction. A similar plan is in use at
Philadelphia, over the valley of Wissahikon, consisting of two
20 inch cast-iron flange pipes serving as top members of a series
of inverted bow-string trusses. There are four spans, each 169
feet 9 inches. Center span 100 feet above ordinary level of the
water.</p>

<p>The Boston aqueduct crosses the Charles River by syphon
pipes&mdash;two, 30 inches, and the other 36 inches in diameter.
Starting from a pipe chamber on the western side of the valley,
the pipe descends 52.11 feet below the level of conduit, and
rests on a masonry bridge of three arches.</p>

<p>One of the syphons for supplying Madrid, Spain, crosses a
valley 4,560 feet in length, consisting of four lines of cast-iron
pipes three feet in diameter.</p>

<p>Dublin is supplied through 30,336 yards of 33-inch and 8,272<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
yards of two lines of 27-inch cast-iron pipes&mdash;20,000 yards laid
through private property. The average fall is 20 feet per mile.
There are three relief-tanks on line of 33-inch pipe. The capacity
of this pipe was calculated at sixteen millions per
day, while the actual delivery exceeded twenty millions.</p>

<p>Toronto is supplied by a 4-foot wooden pipe, 7,000 feet in
length, under pressure.</p>

<p>Manchester, N. H., has a wooden penstock, six feet in
diameter, 600 feet in length, that conveys supply to water
wheels, under a head of twelve feet at entrance and thirty-eight
feet at outlet.</p>

<p>The new conduit for water supply of Baltimore is a continuous
tunnel, seven miles long, running from the dam to the
receiving reservoir&mdash;“Lake Montebello.” In its construction
no open cuts were made; all work being done by drifting.
Its depth below the surface of ground varies from 65 to 360
feet. The internal diameter is 12 feet; the fall is one foot per
mile; capacity 170 millions daily. Fifteen shafts were sunk
during the constructive work. Two miles of the tunnel were
through material that required to be arched with brick; the
remaining distance was through very hard rock that did not
require arching. The cost of this structure was about two
millions of dollars.</p>

<p>Chicago has two tunnels under Lake Michigan, parallel with
each other, 46 feet apart, extending to a crib, located in
the lake, two miles from the shore. The first one was started,
in 1864, under adverse criticism, and successfully completed in
1867. The cost, with the crib, was $457,800. It is five feet
horizontal diameter, and 5′ 2″ vertical diameter, and made of
brick. The second one was built in 1872-’74; is five feet in diameter,
lined with brick. It extends from the North Side Works,
a further distance of 20,000 feet, under the city and Chicago
River to West Side Works. The cost of this tunnel, under the
river, was $414,000, and under the city $543,000. The nature
of the excavation was generally through stiff blue clay with occasionally
<ins class="corr" id="tn-55" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'pockets of quick sand'">
pockets of quicksand</ins>.</p>

<p>The Sudbury conduit, of Boston Water-Works, is sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
miles long, with a grade of 1.056 feet per mile. The top is a
semicircle of nine feet diameter, and the bottom is an arc of
13.22 feet radius, struck from a center 5.53 feet above the
crown of the arch. The sectional area is 56.75 square feet.
The foundation is of concrete; the side walls and spandrel
backing of rubble stone masonry; the lining of brick, four
inches thick, and the arch of brick, twelve inches thick. The
Charles River is crossed by a granite bridge, 475 feet long
and 75 feet high, with two segmental and five semicircle
arches.</p>

<p>On the line of the Vanne conduit there is an aqueduct made
entirely of “beton,” which spans the valleys and quicksands
in the great forest of Fontainebleau, between La Vanne River
and Paris.</p>

<h3>DAMS.</h3>

<p>The disastrous failures of earth dams has excited suspicion
as to the stability of such structures; but when we consider
the immensity of the dams in India, our concern should
be only for the care and attention given to their construction.
There the material used is well puddled; then a drove of cattle
is turned loose on the fill, to stamp the earth thoroughly. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
method is repeated in layers until the required height is reached.
Often the Sepoys do the stamping.</p>

<p>The Veranun reservoir dam is twelve miles in length; and
the amount of earth, of which it is composed, will encircle the
globe with a belt six feet in thickness.</p>

<p>There is a dam on the island of Ceylon made of huge stone
blocks strongly cemented together and covered over with turf,
making a solid barrier of fifteen miles in length, one hundred
feet wide at the base, sloping at top to forty feet, and extending
across the lower end of a spacious valley.</p>

<p class="p1">One of the recent dams of the Croton supply, made of concrete,
is thirty-one feet at the base, eight and one-half feet at
top, six hundred and seventy feet long, and seventy-eight feet
high. The main embankment, which forms Lough Vartry of
the Dublin Water-Works, is sixty-six feet high at its deepest
part, and the greatest depth of water, sixty feet. It is 1,640
feet long on the top, and twenty-eight feet wide, which forms a
public road. The base, at the deepest part, is 380 feet wide;
the inner slope being 3 to 1, and the outer slope 2½ to 1,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
and the total quantity of earthwork in it is 320,000 cubic yards.
The puddle wall in the embankment is six feet wide at the
top (one foot below the top bank), and eighteen feet wide at
the level of the old river bed. It was carried, for its entire
length, down into solid rock.</p>

<p>The dam of Bradlee basin, Boston, is 2,000 feet in length,
twenty feet wide on top, one hundred and fifty feet at the base,
and greatest height thirty-five feet. In the center of the bank
is a puddle wall ten feet thick at the base, and four feet at the
top, founded on the rock. The earth embankment was laid in
layers, well watered and rolled.</p>

<p>The dam for diverting the waters of Gunpowder Falls, for
supply of Baltimore, is built of rubble and white marble upon
solid rock. Thickness at base is sixty-two feet; depth of foundation
below original surface is thirteen feet; width of the overflow
is three hundred feet. The wings extend into the hill on
each side two hundred and fifty-six feet. The height from the
extreme foundation to the overflow is twenty-nine feet. The
filling of the clay and earth on the inside is forty-five feet at
the base.</p>

<p>Liverpool, Eng., designs constructing a masonry dam, at the
source of the new supply in Wales, eighty-four feet in height.</p>

<h3>PUMPING SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>The divisions of power are:</p>

<div class="pfs80">
Wind Power.
<span class="pad3">Water Power.</span>
<span class="pad3">Steam Power.</span>
</div>

<p>And the methods of supply by:</p>

<div class="pfs80">
Reservoir.
<span class="pad3">Stand Pipe.</span>
<span class="pad3">Direct or Holly Plan.</span>
</div>

<p>The value of a pumping system recommends itself on the
point of economy in construction, for the outlay is in proportion
to the existing necessities, which can be increased as the
demands require. The original water consumers are not, therefore,
taxed so heavily for future exigencies of gravity works.
This idea can be better illustrated by the comparative cost of
construction and maintenance of gravitation and pumping works:</p>

<p class="p1">The reservoir system is the most preferable of the three
methods, when natural elevation can be secured, for the pumping
service is distinct from the distribution; and, where reservoirs
of large capacities are obtainable, a closer margin for reserve
pumping power can be adopted, besides a storage reservoir provides
for contingencies that may arise, and allow cessation of
pumping during the turbidity of water source, caused by sudden
freshets.</p>

<p>The stand-pipe is adopted where the elevated grounds are not
sufficient for reservoir purposes, to give a desirable water pressure;
or where reservoirs may not be desired, but to secure the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
head and provide for a constant and reliable action of the pump
that is not obtained by a direct system.</p>

<p>The direct system, commonly called the Holly Plan, does away
with reservoir and stand pipe, and delivers the water directly into
the mains under a pressure usually fifty pounds per square inch
for domestic use, which is increased <ins class="corr" id="tn-60" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'to one hunded'">
to one hundred</ins> pounds when
fires occur. In the Holly Plan, a reserve power is used for fire
purposes, besides mechanical device for regulating and controlling
the variable pressure.</p>

<p>In either the stand pipe or direct system, a reserve power
should be provided equal to the largest daily consumption.</p>

of the United <ins class="corr" id="tn-60a" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'States and Canadas'">

<p>The term, duty of a pumping engine, is a conventional one,
used by engineers to measure the relative merits of performance,
or effective work, expressed by the ratio of product in
foot pounds of the weight water into the height it is lifted, to
one hundred pounds of the coal consumed to lift the water.

Engineers and Steam Users,” by John W. Hill, M. E. (1878),

<h3>STAND PIPE.</h3>

<p>New York has a stand-pipe, for high service use, 170 feet high.</p>

<p>Cleveland has a stand-pipe 148 feet high, 36 inches in diameter.</p>

<p>The stand-pipe at Louisville is 48 inches in diameter, 132 feet
high, made of ¼ to ½-inch wrought-iron plates, the whole incased
in wood.</p>

<p>The Mt. Auburn High Service at Cincinnati is supplied by
two wrought-iron tanks (which answer the same purpose of
stand pipes), each 60 feet in diameter and 38 feet high, and
made of wrought-iron sheets 50″ by 140″, ¼″ to 7-16″ in thickness.
The water surface is 483 feet above low water. The
cost of each tank was $15,000.</p>

<p>The water-tower at Toledo consists of a wrought-iron stand
pipe, around which is built a masonry structure of solid stonework
36 feet square, commencing 16 feet below the natural surface,
with a vertical thickness, under base of stand-pipe, of 7
feet; thence, with octagonal opening around the pipe, to a point
near 3 feet above the surface of the ground, at which point its
inner diameter is 16 feet, and outer dimensions 30 feet square.
From this point, to a further height of four feet, the wall is composed
of ashlar-face and brick backing; thence to a point 70
feet above the foundation of solid brick-work with octagon interior
and exterior squares, the corners terminating in buttress
walls; the top to be octagonal battering to an external diameter
at the top of 14 feet. The total height is 224 feet, and the cost
about $25,000.</p>

<p>A steel plate stand-pipe designed by J. D. Cook, civil engineer
for Springfield, Ohio, is in course of erection by the Stacey
Manufacturing Company of Cincinnati, which will be 112 feet
high, 30 feet in diameter, thickness of lower ring being 25-32″,
and upper ring 3-16″. The estimated cost is $35,000.</p>

<p>The stand-pipe of Southwark and Vauxhall Water-Works,
London, is 178 feet high, made of three columns of cast-iron
pipe, the center one extending 50 feet higher than the other
columns. The side pipes are 30 inch, and center 48 inch in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
diameter. The Grand Junction works, London, has a similar
structure of two columns 153 feet high, incased in a brick
structure.</p>

<p>The stand-pipe of East London Co. is 240 feet high and 3
feet in diameter.</p>


<h3>HUSBAND’S PATENT BALANCE VALVE.</h3>

<p>This patent is designed to supersede the costly stand-pipe.
Fixed vertically, as near to the engine as practicable, is a strong
casting provided with two short-flanged branches, the lower
one being connected with the discharge outlet from the pumps,
and the upper one with the delivery main. Between these
branches a gun-metal valve of the double-seat description is
placed, and is connected to an additional water-tight hat working
on the top of the valve-seating. The seating is firmly held
down by bolts passing through it and fastened to the casing.
A ram lined with gun-metal, and of the same diameter as the
upper valve, is secured water-tight into it by a colter, and
works vertically up and down, passing through a stuffing-box
packed with cup leather, bolted to the upper portion of the
casing. The head of the ram works in a cross-guide lashed
with gun-metal, and supported by four strong vertical pillars.
The ram is loaded with weights nearly equal to the minimum
load of the engine; the lowest weight is provided with lugs
working loosely over the vertical pillars, which are provided
with adjusting nuts and leather washers, for the purpose of preventing
the valve from falling heavily and injuring its seating.
The action of the apparatus is as follows: The water, on entering
the casing from the pumps, acts upon the under side of the
upper valve. The area of the valve is the same as that of the
ram, which, being loaded somewhat under the working load of
the engine, is immediately lifted, raising the valve with it, and
thus giving the water free access to the delivery main.</p>

<p>In the event of the main being fractured at any point beyond
the valve, the pressure within the main is suddenly reduced on
account of the great escape of water, and is, consequently, unable
to support the loaded valve, which immediately closes;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
thus the working load of the engine is retained, and the possibility
of accident by racing prevented.</p>

<p><em>New York</em> was supplied by dug wells until 1842, when the
Croton water was brought, by gravitation, into the city, through
a brick aqueduct, thirty-eight miles in length, crossing the Harlem
River by “High Bridge.” The area of the water-shed of
the Croton is 338.82 square miles. The storage capacity nine
billion gallons. The capacity of the aqueduct is ninety-two
millions of gallons per day.</p>

<p>There are three distributing reservoirs:</p>

<p>The population is 1,206,500; miles of water-pipe, 500&mdash;the
largest being seventy-two inches in diameter; the average daily
consumption of water ninety-five millions; number of taps,
77,000. All buildings are assessed by frontage-tax besides usual
water rates. The meter rate is 7½ cents per thousand gallons.</p>

<p>The original cost of the gravitation works was about nine
millions; present water-works valuation is thirty-two millions.</p>

<p>An additional supply from Bronx River is now in course of
construction. The water will be conducted through an aqueduct,
of forty-eight inch cast-iron pipe, twenty miles in length.
During last summer a water-famine was prevented by a Providential
rain-fall.</p>

<p><em>Philadelphia</em> was supplied with water, systematically, in 1801;
previously, wells were the only source.</p>

<p>The system of supply is pumping by steam and water-power,
thirty-seven per cent. being done by the water-wheels in 1880.</p>

<p>The available capacity of water-wheels is 36,000,000 gallons
daily. During summer there is a deficiency of power. Capacity
of all the pumps 71.8 million gallons. There are 16 reservoirs,
with a total capacity of 200 millions. The distribution of water
is divided among the various works in relation to respective elevation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
The population, in 1880, was 846,984. Miles of pipe,
746. Daily average consumption, in 1880, 57.7 millions.
Largest daily consumption 80½ millions. Number of meters
30. Total receipts, in 1880, were nearly 1½ millions of dollars;
and expenditures nearly $400,000. Laying of water-pipes assessed
on abutting property. Total profits, since 1855, over
twelve millions of dollars.</p>

<p class="p1"><em>Brooklyn.</em>&mdash;Water-works introduced in 1859. The system is
by pumping, with reservoir distribution. The source is the
southern slope of Long Island Sound, ten to twenty-two miles
from East River. The water is gathered from a drainage area
of 60½ square miles by intercepting ponds, and conducted,
through masonry conduit, to the pump well, seven miles
from East River. The natural flow, from these ponds, into
the conduit being insufficient during summer time, pumping
engines were erected, 1874, at Watts’ and Smith’s ponds to
meet the deficiency.</p>

<p>The storage reservoir, built in 1873-’76, has a water surface
of 250 acres, and a capacity of one billion gallons. There are
three low-pressure beam-engines, with a combined capacity of 44
millions daily. The distributing reservoir is 3,400 feet from pumping
wells, at 163 feet elevation and with a capacity of 160 millions.</p>

<p>Population, in 1880, was 566,689. Miles of pipe, 351. Daily
average consumption of water, in 1880, 30¾ millions. Largest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
daily consumption 48 millions; number of taps, 60,000;
meters, 859; original cost of works, $5,200,000.</p>

<p><em>Chicago.</em>&mdash;The first works were constructed by the Chicago
City Hydraulic Company in 1840, Lake Michigan being the
source. The superiority of this water, as compared with well
water, so manifested itself during the cholera of 1849-’50 that
the works became a public institution, under whose control
they were enlarged, in 1854, after plans of Wm. J. McAlpine,
C. E. The system is constant pumping through stand-pipe
distribution, 120 feet above city datum. There are two pumping
stations&mdash;North Side and West Side&mdash;the latter being the
new works, erected in 1874. The source is Lake Michigan.
Previous to 1867 the intakes were near the shore; and, in order
to secure pure water, a brick tunnel, five feet wide by five feet
two inches in depth, was built under the lake, a length of two
miles, to a crib located in the lake. A second tunnel, 5 ft. in diameter,
parallel to the first, and forty-six feet apart, was constructed
to the North Side Works, thence continuing under the
city, a distance of 20,000 feet, to the West Side Works. The
North Side Works has four engines, with a combined capacity
of 64 millions; and the West Side Works two engines, with a
capacity of 46 millions.</p>

<p>In 1856 a twenty-four inch wrought main was laid in the
Chicago River; but, before brought into use, was injured by
pile-driving, and had to be relaid. In 1869 all the submerged
mains were abandoned, because of frequent accidents, and brick
tunnels, six feet in diameter, were built under the river. The
statistics for 1880 were: Population, 503,304; miles of pipe,
450; daily average consumption, 57.4 million gallons; number
of meters, 2,000. Cost of West Side Works, with new tunnel,
$1,600,000. Total cost of works, $8,644,000.</p>

<p><em>Boston.</em>&mdash;In 1835 there were 2,767 wells in use, thirty-three
of which were artesian, besides a water-works under the control
of “The Aqueduct Corporation.” Out of the whole number
of wells only seven furnished water soft enough to use for washing.
In 1840 there was great complaint of the deficiency of
wells, and in one case it was stated that a well from which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
many drew their water, was kept locked except at certain
hours. During this time there were 56 reservoirs, each holding
300 to 400 hogsheads. In 1848 water was first introduced from
Lake Cochituate, through a brick conduit (except the cast-iron
syphon over Charles River), oviform in shape, large end down,
6.33 feet high and 5 feet wide. Its length is 14.627 miles, with
a total fall of 4.26 feet. It has a capacity of delivering 16 million
gallons daily, with a velocity of one foot per second. The
area of water surface, at full water, of Lake Cochituate is 800
acres; when drawn down 10 feet or level of the flow line of
conduit, the area is 489 acres. Elevation is 134.36 feet, and
bottom of conduit at dam 121 feet above tide level. There are
two granite dams 500 feet apart. The first dam was built on
quicksand, and after filling of the lake, springs boiled up and
washed away the sand.</p>

<p>The new supply from Sudbury River was inaugurated in
1878. The drainage is 78.24 square miles. The conduit is 16
miles long, with a grade of 1.056 feet per mile. It is built
of concrete and rubble masonry, lined with brick. It crosses
the Charles River by granite bridge 475 feet long and 75 feet
high. Its sectional area is 56.75 square feet, and capacity 70
millions daily.</p>

<p>There are two earth embankment reservoirs, one of 120 millions
and the other of 550 millions capacity, besides four stone
masonry structures of 22 millions capacity combined. One of
the latter is used for high service, is 219 feet above tide, and
has a capacity of 7 millions. The Roxbury High Service is
supplied by two 20″ by 36″ pumps, through a stand-pipe 5
feet in diameter and 80 feet high. There is also a couple of
temporary high service works. There are several cast-iron
syphons of 20 and 24-inch pipes, with ball and socket points,
submerged in the rivers. A crack in one of these 20-inch pipes
was stopped by pine wedges, and then covered with an india-rubber
band, secured by iron clamps. The work was done by
a diver, and occupied three weeks. The Mystic Water-Works,
of Charleston, became a part of the Boston Water System in
1873, by annexation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>The population is 412,000; miles of pipe, 500; daily average
consumption, 36 millions; number of water takers is 68,334.
There are 1,313 meters in use. The value of the works to December,
1880, was $18,354,716.17.</p>

<p><em>St. Louis.</em>&mdash;The first water-works was built at foot of Bates
Street in 1830, eight years after it became an incorporated city.
The old works were entirely abandoned in 1872, when the new
works, built after the design of Jas. P. Kirkwood, civil engineer,
were put in operation. The new pumping stations is at
Bissell’s Point at the northern city limit. The water is taken
from Mississippi River, through a cast-iron tower (arranged to
take water at any level) sunk in the river to the bed rock, and
conducted by a 66-inch iron pipe to the first or low service
pumps, which raises the water from 15 to 50 feet, according to
the stage of the river, into settling basins (four in number,
each 25 millions capacity); from thence it flows through a brick
conduit 1,100 feet long, to the clear well of the high service or
main works. The clear water is pumped through a stand pipe
into a reservoir on Compton Hill, 870 feet by 540 feet, and 22
feet deep, and 176 feet above city directrix. The low service
works has two Cornish bull and one rotative engine, and the
main works has three combination beam engines with a combined
capacity of 40 millions of gallons daily. The sediment
in the water amounts, at times, to 1.8 per cent. of the total
bulk. Nine hundred and forty-four parts in one thousand of
the sediment is deposited within twenty-four hours in still water.
One of the old reservoirs was abandoned entirely for twelve
years, on account of the accumulation of deposit, being 30 feet
in depth. It was cleaned by hydraulic mining, after a method
designed by Henry Flad, civil engineer.</p>

<p>The population by last census is 350,522; miles of pipe, 200;
daily consumption, 25 millions; number of taps, 20,000.</p>

<p>The cost of the new works was about five millions of dollars.</p>

<p><em>Baltimore.</em>&mdash;In 1814 an association was formed for the purpose
of introducing a copious supply of wholesome water into
the city from Jones’ Falls. The works were purchased by the
city in 1854 for $1,350,000, and enlarged in 1857-’62. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
river water is diverted into Lake Roland, an artificial lake of
116 acres water surface. From this reservoir it is brought
through an elliptical conduit, 3.62 miles, and discharged into
Hampden Reservoir. This reservoir is semicircle in form,
1,000 feet diameter, with a water surface of 8 acres. It is 217
feet above tide. From this point the water flows through three
lines of 30-inch cast-iron pipe, 7,100 feet in length, into Mt.
Royal Reservoir, which is a circular structure 550 feet in diameter
with a water surface of 5 acres, and 150 feet above tide.
This reservoir supplies that portion of the city below 112 feet
elevation. The Hampden Reservoir supplies the districts between
112 feet and 188 feet above tide, and the high service
reservoir the district between 188 feet and 320 feet above tide.
In 1867 the Druid Lake was constructed with a view of storing
clear water, to be used when Lake Roland was muddy. It is
made by building an earthen dam (across a natural valley in
Druid Hill Park), 119 feet high in the middle with a puddled
wall in the center 36 feet wide at the bottom. The greatest
depth of water is 63 feet. Seven lines of cast-iron pipe were
originally laid under the embankment, but broke within two
years. Five lines of 30-inch pipe were then laid through a cut-in
rock. Its capacity is 493,000,000 gallons, with water surface
of 53 acres. The high service reservoir is circular, 500 feet diameter,
20 feet deep, and 350 feet above tide, and supplied by
two Worthington pumps.</p>

<p>The new supply from Gunpowder River is brought through
a 12-foot conduit 7 miles in length, having a capacity of 170
million gallons, to Montebello Reservoir, of 80 acres water surface,
and 163 feet above tide. From here it is conveyed partly
in tunnel and in open cut 5,391 feet to Lake Clifton, which has
a water surface of 30¼ acres and elevation 163 feet above tide,
and 31 feet deep. Provisions are made for six 40-inch mains;
two now being used. The new system cost $4,704,260.83, and
was formerly inaugurated in October, 1881. The statistics for
1880 are: population, 332,190; miles of pipe, 277; water takers,
49,000; meters, 524; outstanding bonds amounting to 9 million
dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p><em>Buffalo</em> takes its supply from a pier in Niagara River, and is
conducted through a tunnel 22½ feet below the river bottom.
The system is pumping and reservoir distribution with Holly
plan for fire purposes and supply of higher levels. At the
pumping station there are two Worthingtons&mdash;one of 10 million
and the other of 15 million capacity&mdash;and a condensing beam
engine of 8 million capacity. A third Worthington is now in
course of erection. There are three Holly pumps, one of 1½
millions; one of 2½ millions; and one of 6 millions capacity,
which take their supply from the face main 20 feet below the
reservoir, and pump directly into the mains. The statistics for
1880 are: population, 155,137; miles of pipe, 102; daily consumption,
16½ million gallons; water-takers, 9,099. The original
cost of the works was $400,000. Present value 3 million
dollars, outstanding bonds $2,950,000.</p>

<p><em>Washington</em> is supplied from the Potomac River by diverting
the waters at Great Falls 17 miles above the city, by a dam of
cut masonry with rip-rap backing. Its top is 148 feet above
tide level at Washington. The water is conducted through a
brick aqueduct 9 feet in diameter, with a grade of 0.75 feet per
mile. The reservoir at Powder Mill Branch (made by damming
the stream), has a water surface of 50 acres, with a capacity
of 176 million gallons. The expectation that the Potomac
water, which is frequently very muddy, would have time to
settle in this reservoir before being drawn from its outlet was
not realized in consequence of the turbidity of drainage water
collected by the reservoir itself; a connecting conduit was therefore
built in 1864 to supply direct from Potomac River, during
freshets, in Powder Mill Branch.</p>

<p>The high levels of Georgetown or those more than 90 feet
above tide level, are supplied by pumping and reservoir distribution.
The reservoir is a hemispherical brick structure, 120
feet in diameter, and 220 feet above tide.</p>

<p>The statistics for 1880 are: population, 147,307; miles of
pipe, 175; daily consumption of water, 26 million gallons; number
of taps, 17,000. Cost of aqueduct and its maintenance to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
June 30, 1880, was 3.8 million dollars, and for water mains, 1.7
millions.</p>

<p><em>Louisville.</em>&mdash;The Louisville Water Company was chartered in
1854, and in 1856 the city subscribed to the capital stock to
the amount of $550,000. The supply is taken from the Ohio
River, 1½ miles above the city limits. The intake is 300 feet
from shore, 50 feet in diameter, made of a crib of timber filled in
with stone, the mouth of the inlet being 5 by 12 feet, and set 1 foot
below lowest stage of water. By 1865 the inlet pipe was half
full of silt; in order to clean it a well was sunk over the pipe,
105 feet from its end, the pipe cut, and then cleaned out. In
1877 the pipe was again cleansed. Anchor ice has given them
much trouble. There are two Cornish beam engines which deliver
the water through a wrought-iron stand pipe, 48 inches in
diameter and 132 feet high, into a reservoir of earth embankments,
141 feet above low water, and 3,650 feet from the works.
The water surface of this reservoir is 178 by 374 feet. The new
reservoir on Crescent Hill is 175 feet above low water, and 2½
miles from stand-pipe. It has a capacity of 100 millions. Notwithstanding
extraordinary care having been taken in the foundations
of this reservoir, leaks and slips occurred soon after it
was filled.</p>

<p>The statistics for 1880 are: Population, 123,645; miles of
pipe, 110; daily consumption of water, 5½ million gallons;
number of meters, 201; hydraulic elevators. 50; value of the
works&mdash;construction, $800,000; enlargements, $2,400,000; total,
3.2 million dollars.</p>

<p><em>San Francisco</em> is supplied by the Spring Valley Water Company
from three sources. One from Lobos Creek, 4 miles from
the city, where the water is gathered after slow percolation
through sand, and conducted through 23,700 feet of wood and
masonry aqueduct to the pumping-works (at zero datum of city
level) at Point Black. These engines raise the water into two
reservoirs on Russian Hill, respectively 396 feet and 139 feet
above city datum. The ordinary yield of the source is 2¼
millions daily. Another source is from the mountains of San
Mateo County, 15 miles from San Francisco, where a dam was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
built in 1864, 640 feet long, 26 feet wide on top, 95 feet high,
with slopes 2¾ and 2½ to 1 foot. A puddle-trench is sunk
26 feet below the natural surface to the rock. After the reservoir
was full, a leak appeared at one end of the dam caused by
an unsound rock. While the reservoir was full a shaft was sunk
80 feet deep to the point, and the rock removed and replaced
with puddle. This reservoir is 46 feet deep, and has a capacity
of 1,083 million gallons, with a water surface of 692 feet above
the sea. The water is conducted 13 miles, through a flume
partly of 30-inch wrought-iron pipe, to Lagunda Honda Reservoir,
377 feet above the sea, with a capacity of 33 million
gallons.</p>

<p>The third supply is brought from the water-shed of Lock’s
Creek, 2.75 square miles in area, and 505 feet above tide.
This water is conveyed 17.42 miles to St. Andres Reservoir
through wrought-iron pipes and tunnels lined with solid masonry.</p>

<p>The St. Andres Reservoir has a capacity of 7,000 million
gallons, and is formed by an earth dam 640 feet long, 25 feet
wide on the top, and 93 feet high, with a puddle-trench 47
feet more to the rock. The cost of the works to 1875 was
$8,746,928.12. Amount paid on dividends to stockholders
$4,701,562.18.</p>

<p>The population in 1880 was 233,956, and daily consumption
of water 17 millions.</p>

<p><em>Cleveland.</em>&mdash;The water-works were constructed in 1853 after
the plans of T. R. Scowden, civil engineer. The system is
pumping through stand pipe with reservoir distribution. The
source is Lake Erie, where the water is taken through a crib
located in lake, 1¼ miles from shore, and conducted through
tunnel under lake to the pump wells. The pumping stations
contains two Cornish, a “Henderson” compound duplex, and
a 10 million Worthington. The combined capacity is 28 million
gallons. Another Worthington engine is being added to
the service. The stand pipe is 148 feet high and 36 inches in
diameter. The reservoir is made of earth embankments, 21 feet
deep, with a capacity of 8 million gallons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>The population for 1880 was 160,142; miles of pipe, 125½;
daily consumption of water, 10.18 million gallons.</p>

<p>Total cost of works to January 1, 1878, was $2,402,000.
Bonded indebtedness, $1,725,000. Cost of original works,
$523,000.</p>

<p><em>Portland, Maine</em>, is supplied with water from Lake Sebago,
which has storage capacity sufficient to supply the largest city
of the world. The total area of water-shed is 520 square miles.
The annual receipt of moisture, including rain and snow, is 51
billion cubic feet, while the discharge is 20½ billion cubic feet.
The water is conveyed partly through a box conduit, 3′ 9″ by 3′
6½″, an oval brick conduit 5,440 feet long, 2½′ by 3½′, to a
gate-house, whence two wrought-iron mains, lined inside and
covered outside with best quality Rosendale cement, each 16
miles long, distribute the water to the city. One of the mains
is 20 inches in diameter for the whole length, the other 26 and
24 inches, and respectively 4 and 12 miles long. The water
system is owned by the Portland Water Company.</p>

<p><em>Cincinnati.</em>&mdash;The permanent system of water supply was commenced
in 1817, when city council granted to the Cincinnati
Manufacturing Company the privilege of supplying the city with
water for ninety-nine years at an annual consideration of $100&mdash;the
water to flow three feet above the first floor of James Ferguson’s
kitchen, on west side of Vine, between Sixth and
Seventh Streets, by 1820.</p>

<p>The first water was drawn from a wooden penstock <ins class="corr" id="tn-77" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'at Sycaamore Street'">
at Sycamore Street</ins> and Lower Market, July, 1821, being raised by
horse-power from Ohio River at the present site of pumping
works, and forced into a wooden reservoir, and from thence delivered
through wooden pipes to water consumers.</p>

<p>The Cincinnati Manufacturing Company transferred its privileges,
in 1820, to Samuel W. Davis, and by him sold to Cincinnati
Water Company in 1825. The entire works were purchased by
the city in 1839, for the sum of $300,000, and consisted of
19 miles of wooden pipes, 3½ miles of iron pipe, reservoir in
three compartments of 1,700,000 gallons capacity, two high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
pressure pumping engines with a capacity of 4,200,000 gallons
per twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The management of the water department was vested first with
a board of directors composed of one councilman from each
ward. In 1847 this power was given, by act of legislature,
to a board of three trustees elected by the people, and in
1876 the Board of Public Works was established, which assumed
entire control of all the public works, including the water-works.</p>

<p>The city is supplied by pumping and reservoir system, with
a main and two auxiliary pumping works, and four distinct reservoir
or distributing services.</p>

<p>The main work is located on the bank of the Ohio River, and
takes its supply through two stone aqueducts, each 100 feet in
length. The western one is extended 60 feet further into the
channel of the river by two 40-inch wrought-iron pipes.</p>

<p>The pumping engines at these works are&mdash;three double and
three single engines with a combined theoretical capacity of 49
millions, with present available capacity of 32 millions. The
oldest reservoir, built in 1850-’53, is a stone structure, entirely
above the surface ground, made in two divisions 23 feet in
depth; the eastern part being 163 by 116 feet, and western
180 by 116 feet. Its capacity is 5½ million gallons. The cost
was $50,000; its elevation, 176 feet above low-water mark in
the Ohio River. The largest reservoir is built in a ravine,
where a masonry structure was erected 1,251 feet long, 120 feet
high, 48½ feet in width at the bottom, and 25 feet on top.
There are two compartments formed by a masonry wall 307 feet
in length, 30 feet at the base, 10 feet on top, and 67½ feet extreme
height. The upper part contains 57 millions, and the
lower 43 million gallons, at 30 feet depth. The elevation of
flow line is 235 feet above low water in the Ohio River. The
cost was $1,660,000. The high service No. 1 supplies nearly
two millions daily to the hill-tops, pumping into two iron tanks,
each 60 feet diameter by 38 feet high, 310 feet above the pumping
station level, through 2,700 feet of 20-inch and 4,501 feet of
16-inch cast-iron pipe. The cost of this service to 1881, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
forty miles of pipe, two pumping engines of six million capacity,
tanks, etc., was nearly half a million dollars.</p>

<p>No. 2, high service, was started in June, 1881. About 15,000
gallons are pumped daily into an iron tank, thirty feet in diameter
by sixteen feet high, temporarily erected on wooden supports
sixteen feet high. The elevation of flow line of tank is
354 feet above the pump station.</p>

<p class="p1"><em>Toledo</em> established her water-works in 1873-’74, after plans
of J. D. Cook, C. E. The water is taken from the Maumee
River, through a hexagonal crib, made of two rows of piling,
with the space filled with broken stone and coarse gravel, and
conveyed, through wrought-iron pipe and five foot brick conduit
five hundred feet long, to filter gallery of 19,000 square feet.
The filtering material is 24 inches of broken stone, 6 inches of
2-inch gravel, 6 inches of 1-inch gravel, 6 inches of ½-inch
gravel, 6 inches of ¼-inch gravel, and 24 inches of fine sand.
Maximum depth of water is four feet. The filtered water is discharged
into a clear-water reservoir by means of gathering drains
and an effluent pipe, and thence to the pump well. There are
two Worthington engines, each of five million capacity, pumping
against a 260-foot lift, into a stand-pipe. The cost of the

<p class="p1">The East London Company has its intakes further up the
Thames than the other works, where pumping engines, of 750
horse-power, are capable of delivering ten million gallons daily,
through a stand-pipe 240 feet high and three feet in diameter,
into its subsiding reservoirs. It also takes its supply partly from
the Lea River.</p>

<p>The West Middlesex Company is above Hampton, and two
miles below the East London Company’s works. The water is
drawn from the river every day, whatever its state may be; but,
in times of exceptionally foul water, the intake is reduced as
much as possible.</p>

<p>Close to the West Middlesex Company is the Grand Junction
works. Near the latter are the works of the Southwark &amp; Vauxhall
Company. And at Thames Ditton, two miles further down,
are the Lambeth and Chelsea works.</p>

<p>The Kent Water Company takes its supply, exclusively, from
deep wells in the chalk. The New River Company takes its
supply chiefly from the Lea River. It has supplied a large
portion of London, for two hundred and seventy years, through
a conduit originally forty miles in length, which has been shortened
by various cuts.</p>

<p>The statistics, as per monthly report for July, 1875, were:
Population, 3,713,108; miles of pipe, 3,074; daily average consumption
from Thames, 64,791,000 gallons; daily average consumption
from other sources, 57,528,000 gallons. Total daily
average, 122,319,000 gallons.</p>

<p>The Capital invested in the supply of water by these eight
companies represents a total sum of $51,900,000.</p>

<p class="p1">An act of 1871 provides power to compel the companies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
to give constant supply when the public authorities may demand
it.</p>

<p>By the act of 1872 a Government Inspector was appointed,
who examines and reports monthly the condition of the works
and the character of the water furnished.</p>

<p>As the London and Lea Rivers have been condemned by
the Rivers Pollution Commission, as well as the shallow surface
wells, of which they say, are not fit for human consumption,
several schemes have been proposed for new or improved sources.</p>

<p>Mr. Bateman proposed to furnish a daily supply, equal to 220
million gallons, from the mountains of North Wales, where the
annual rain-fall amounts from 70 to 150 inches. The cost was
estimated at $51,000,000.</p>

<p>The plan proposed by Messrs. Hemans and Hassard is to
gather the water from the mountains in Cumberland, where a
supply equal to 250 million gallons daily can be secured for the
sum of $61,000,000. The Rivers Pollution Commission were
of the opinion, that an ample supply of wholesome water could
be secured from the chalk wells and springs, within a radius not
exceeding fifty miles of London.</p>

<p><em>Liverpool</em> had in 1874, 493,405 inhabitants. It is supplied
with water partly by gravitation and partly by pumping from
deep wells in and near the city. The gravitation-works are situated
on the slopes of Rivington Pike, a distance about 33 miles.
One-third of the storage water is required for compensation purposes.
The area of water-shed is 10,000 acres; that of the impounding
reservoirs and filter-beds 549 acres, with a storage capacity
of 3¼ billion gallons. The ordinary work of the six
filter-beds is 14 million gallons daily.</p>

<p>The materials used for filtration are: 2½ feet sharp river
sand, clean gravel of the following depths and sizes: 6 inches
⅛-inch diameter, 6 inches ¼-inch diameter, 6 inches ½-inch
diameter, 6 inches 1-inch diameter, and 6 inches 2-inch diameter;
6 inches of broken stone 4-inch diameter, and 12 inches
broken stone 6-inch diameter. The cost of filtration is $1.37
per million gallons. The water, after filtration, flows from the
clear water tank through a main, 44 inches diameter and 18<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
miles in length, to the service reservoir at Prescott, 102 feet
lower than the clear water tank; to break the pressure in this
length there are two small reservoirs. From Prescott the line
is continued by two pipes, one 44 inches and the other 36
inches in diameter, a distance of five miles to the service reservoirs,
which are seven in number, with a water surface area of
37⅓ acres, and 114 million gallons capacity. They are partly
above ground and covered. The quantity delivered through
the conduit, is 10⅓ million gallons daily.</p>

<p>There are four pumping stations located at the respective
wells, with five Cornish and five Bolton and Watts’ condensing
engines. Four pumping stations have been abandoned on account
of the pollution in well water. Part of the town is supplied
directly from mains and partly from cisterns. It is now
compulsory for all new property to be provided with cisterns, and
that the overflow-pipe be carried outside the premises instead
of being connected to soil-pipe or sewer. A special staff of men
is employed to make house-to-house inspection of all water fittings
and appliances. The cost of the water-works was about 10
million dollars, and is inadequate. They are now constructing
an artificial lake, 1 mile wide by 5 miles long, for impounding the
waters of the Vyrnwy River in North Wales, 780 feet above
the sea level, and 67 miles distant from the city. The area of
water-shed is 22,000 acres. The dam will be a masonry structure,
120 feet extreme depth, and 100 feet wide at base; storage
capacity, 1,900 million gallons. The cost is estimated at
$15,000,000, and daily capacity 52 million gallons.</p>

<p><em>Glasgow.</em>&mdash;The present water system was commenced in 1856,
and completed in 1859, after the designs of Mr. J. F. Bateman,
civil engineer. The supply is taken from Loch Katrine, including
Lochs Drunkie and Vennachar, with a drainage area of
47,800 acres, and a storage capacity of 1,455 million cubic feet.
The total length of aqueduct is 25¾ miles, of which 13 are tunneled,
3¾ of iron pipe across valleys, and remaining 9 miles
of open cuttings and bridges. There are 80 distinct tunnels.
The capacity of aqueduct is 50 million gallons per twenty-four
hours. The amount required for compensation purposes is fixed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
at 40½ million gallons daily, to be discharged into the River
Teith. The cost of the works was 6 million dollars. The water
is exceptionally soft, being less than one degree.</p>

<p><em>Manchester.</em>&mdash;The new supply was commenced in 1848, designed
by Mr. J. F. Bateman, civil engineer. The source is
in the counties of Derby and Chester, 777 feet above city
datum. There are thirteen storage and distributing reservoirs,
with a water surface of 975½ acres, and capacity of 6,458 million
gallons. The greatest depth of reservoirs is 84 feet. The
conduit is 18 miles in length. The drainage area is 19,300
acres. Available daily supply is 33 million gallons, of which
13 millions are required for mill-owners. The average rain-fall
is 50 inches, and mean available resource of 33 inches. The
cost of the works was 4 million dollars. The population in
1874 was 750,000; daily average consumption 16 million gallons,
and 550 miles of pipe.</p>

<p><em>Edinburgh</em> derives its supply from springs and brooks flowing
from the northern slope of the Pentland Mountains. The water
is collected in storage reservoirs, with a capacity of 280 million
cubic feet, three of which are compensating reservoirs for mill-owners.
The conduit is 8 miles in length, and varies from 20
to 15 inches in diameter. The water is distributed directly
into mains with an equalizing cistern on the Castle Hill, 225
feet below the source of supply, and 332 feet above tide. The
capacity of pipe is 253 cubic feet per minute. There were three
filter-beds (in 1868) a short distance below the <ins class="corr" id="tn-84" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'reservoir enbankment'">
reservoir embankment.</ins> The sand surface of each is 90 by 90 feet. The
superficial area of the three filters, 24,300 square feet; maximum
rate of filtration, 85½ U. S. gallons per square foot per
diem. The spring water is not filtered. The additional works
were completed in 1868, which increased the supply to 992 cubic
feet per minute, or 10,685,770 U. S. gallons per day.</p>

<p><em>Dublin</em> secures its water supply from the Vartry River, 24½
miles distant from city, and 692 feet above low water at Dublin.
The area of water-shed is 14,084 acres; the storage capacity, 2,400
million gallons. The water is conveyed through a 33-inch cast-iron
pipe (with an average fall of 20 feet to the mile) to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
Stillogram distributing reservoir. There are three receiving
tanks on the line, with self-acting valves to shut off the water in
case of pipe bursting. The distributing reservoirs contain 86
million gallons&mdash;are 230 feet above the average head of the city,
and 4½ miles distant. Two 27-inch pipes distribute the water to
the city from this point. There were seven filter-beds in 1875,
each 215 feet and 115 feet at the top and 187 feet by 89 feet
at the bottom, and 10 feet deep. The filtering material is 6½
feet deep, composed of 2½ feet 4-inch stone, 2 feet gravel,
and 2½ feet washed sand. The head on filter-bed was increased
from 2 to 3 feet to secure larger supply. The total cost of this
new supply was 3 million dollars. The water-rate taxation is
26½d. per pound. The population in 1875 was 330,000; daily
average consumption, 14 million gallons. All plumber fittings
must be inspected and stamped, for which a fee of two cents is
charged. This consumption, by careful inspection, was reduced
from 19 millions. The largest annual rain-fall from 1861 to 1874
was 69.34 inches; minimum, 40.08 inches. Fifteen inches is
allowed for evaporation, leaving 25 inches for available supply
for the dryest year during this period.</p>

<p><em>Berlin.</em>&mdash;The water department is owned by an English company,
called the Berlin Water Company, who have had the exclusive
privilege of supplying filtered water as required by the
contracts since 1856. After 1881 the Government has the option
of taking stock, and should the dividends exceed 10 per
cent., one-half of the surplus is to go to the sewerage fund for
the proposed sewers.</p>

<p>The water is derived mainly from the River Spree, through
a canal reaching to the middle of the river. The pumping station
is one mile outside of the city, in which are located eight
double pumping engines, each pair having two beams, two
pumps, and one fly-wheel. The first four engines erected have
pump-barrels of unequal diameter and stroke, being respectively,
38 and 21½ inches diameter and 32 and 36 inches
stroke. The large barrel was originally used for the delivery
of the river water to the filter-beds under a pressure not exceeding
20 feet; the small barrel delivered the filtered water into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
the city under a varying pressure of 90 to 120 feet. As now
operated, the four oldest engines pump the river water into
the settling or storage basin before filtration; while the other
four deliver the filtered water directly into the city mains, but
the pressure is regulated by a reservoir and stand-pipe along-side
of it. The stand-pipe is double-legged, connected at four
points, each connection having a valve, except the highest. The
highest connection is 200 feet above the pump-house, the lowest
about 115, with others intermediate. The water of the
small reservoir, when full, stands at about 110 feet above the
pump well. There were eleven filters in 1875, with an area of
400,000 square feet. During the summer only eight of the beds
are used effectually. They are cleaned in winter every month,
and every week in summer. One-half of the old sand is replaced
each time of cleansing with new sand. The average rate
of filtration is 90 gallons per square foot, and maximum rate
120 gallons per square foot per twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The filtering materials consist of 24 inches sharp sand, 3
inches of coarse sand, three courses, each 6 inches in depth,
of gravel, of the size of a pea, hazelnut, and walnut, and 9 inches
of granite pieces. The head of water on filter is 39 inches.</p>

<p>Frequently the river water is pumped directly into the filter-beds
without subsidence. The stream is very sluggish in
its velocity, being held back by locks for the purpose of navigation,
the water does not carry sufficient sediment to render
subsidence a necessity. There are, besides, certain lakes not far
above the works through which the river flows, that are effective
settling basins. They, however, communicate to the water
a dark vegetable tinge.</p>

<p>The statistics for 1875 were: Population, 969,000; daily average
consumption, 12¼ million gallons; number of meters,
6,916. Water-rent receipts, for 1875, were $600,000 or 13½
cents per thousand gallons, and expenses were $376,000, or 8
cents per thousand gallons.</p>

<p>The water rents are assessed upon the valuation of the property,
with extra rates for additional water privileges.</p>

<p>New works were erected in 1875-’77, with a daily maximum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
capacity of 12 million gallons. The source is the “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tegeler
See</i>.” The water is collected, by infiltration, in twenty-three
cisterns, each having a separate connection to a suction-pipe,
36 inches diameter, 4,000 feet long, which leads to the pump
wells, stationed midway on the suction line. The cisterns are circular
in form, with two concentric walls, the first of stone, the
second of brick, with an intervening space filled with gravel
through which the water percolates. The interstices of the stone
are small, to prevent the washing in of sand, in which the wells
are made. The water is pumped, by six compound engines, into
a reservoir of two compartments, whence it flows into a second
pumping station at Charlottenburgh, where four compound
engines raise the water a second time, with a lift of 125 feet,
into two reservoirs of six million capacity. The water is then
distributed into the city by two lines, one for the north side,
the other for the south side of the city. The first pumping
station is four miles from the second works, and the latter six
miles from the city.</p>

<p><em>Vienna</em> had a population, in 1875, of 1,007,365. Previous to
the application of the new supply, in 1873, the city was supplied
by ten thousand wells; ten gravitation works, for suburbs, public
and <ins class="corr" id="tn-87" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'private puildings'">
private buildings</ins>, palaces, etc.; four pumping works&mdash;one
for large abattoir, one for the parks, a special supply for the
main street, called Ring Strasse, which cost $75,000, besides
several small private works, and sixty-six public wells for street
sprinkling, etc. The first pumping works was erected in 1843,
by Emperor Ferdinand I., and given by him to the city. The
total cost, to 1871, of this service, was nearly $1,200,000, consisting
of three pumping engines, of Watts’ &amp; Wolf’s designs, with a
gross horse-power of 220; three reservoirs, and a suction and
filter canal 27,000 feet long. The water is taken from a canal
of the Danube, and raised forty-seven feet high. The daily
delivery was 2,600,000 gallons. In 1864, fifteen projects for
supplying the city with water were submitted, and the plan
of securing the spring water from the foot of the Alps was
adopted. Work was commenced in 1870, and completed in
1873. The cost was nearly $11,000,000. The mean quantity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
secured daily from the springs was originally 37 millions, the
maximum 45 millions, and minimum 5½ millions. The water
is collected in three reservoirs, located on mountain ridges, with
a capacity of one million gallons. The conduit is fifty miles
long, and has sixteen tunnels, 5.2 miles long, drifted through
rock and cemented, and nine and one-half miles of masonry
bridges. The water is delivered into a reservoir, arched and
covered with ground; from this it is led into three other
covered reservoirs, with a combined capacity of seven millions.
The quantity realized from the springs was not as large as expected,
and additional springs were added to the source at an
expense of $250,000. It is now the intention to increase the
main pumping works for manufacturing purposes, so as to reduce
the supply of spring water for domestic use.</p>

<p><em>Hamburg</em> had a population, in 1875, of 337,602. The water-works
were erected in 1849. The water is taken from the River
Elbe, through an arched canal, to four pump wells (for subsidence
of the water) with a combined capacity of 53 million gallons.
The water is slightly turbid, except in floods. The pumping
station is two miles above the city, and contains four Cornwall
and one Wolf engine, with a total horse-power of 850.
The water is forced through a stand-pipe 240 feet high, under
a variable pressure, according to the demand, into the pipes.
There are three reservoirs for equalizing the pressure, also storage
of water. Two of them are stone structures; the other is
a covered iron tank on a stone foundation 39⅓ feet high. The
maximum consumption was 19 millions daily; and daily average,
for 1875, was 15¼ millions, or 45 gallons per inhabitant. The
cost of pumping one million gallons is $20, or $8.33 for one
million gallons raised 100 feet high.</p>

<p><em>Frankfort-on-the-Main</em> was supplied by well water. In 1872,
a supply was brought into the city from the Spessart Mountains,
where the water from 139 springs were gathered together, and
conveyed through an aqueduct 41 miles long, two miles of which
is made of cement 9½ to 18 inches in diameter, 38½ miles
of 14½-inch cast-iron pipe, and ½ mile of canal. The water
flows through a syphon tower. There are two reservoirs&mdash;one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
of 3½ millions, and the other of .8 of a million capacity. The
population, in 1875, was 103,136. Daily average consumption,
1¾ million gallons; miles of pipe, 64½.</p>

<p><em>Leipsic.</em>&mdash;The water-works was built, by the city, in 1866, at
a cost of $900,000. The water is taken from the Pleisse River,
through an arched aqueduct, 656 feet long, to subsiding reservoirs
or wells, two miles in diameter, and thirteen feet below the
lowest stage in the river. The water is pumped into a reservoir,
140 feet lift, by two Wolf engines, with a power of 120 horse-power.
The maximum daily consumption of water, in 1876,
was 2.6 millions, and the minimum was 1.8 million gallons.</p>

<p><em>Stuttgart</em> had a population, in 1875, of 107,575. It has two
kinds of supply&mdash;one for drinking, that of spring water, and
the other for manufacturing and general use. For the latter
demands, the supply is taken partly from the Neckar River,
and pumped through three artificial filter beds; and partly from
lakes, whose water is conducted, through cast-iron pipes 15,000
feet in length, to five filter-beds, and thence into two reservoirs,
145 feet below the lake. The reservoir, for the filtered water
from the river, is three miles from the pumping station, and 180
feet elevation. Seven million gallons are used daily.</p>

<p>The spring water is conducted through 23.6 miles of pipe,
into a reservoir of 132,010 gallons capacity. The maximum
daily consumption of spring water, in 1875, was 580,800 gallons,
and minimum consumption 369,600 gallons.</p>

<p><em>Dresden.</em>&mdash;The water-works were erected, in 1875, at a cost
of $2,000,000. The available maximum delivery was 11.88
million gallons per day. The water is taken from the Elbe
River, through two cast-iron pipes, 9.8 feet below low water,
and conveyed to two wells, 23 feet in diameter, dug along-side of
the river. The water is pumped, by six double engines, with 720
horse-power, through 3,608 feet of pipe, into a reservoir 197 feet
above the pumping station. The maximum daily consumption of
water, in 1875, was 3.7 million gallons, and minimum .7 of a million;
population, 197,000. In 1876 there were 2,047 meters in use.</p>

<p><em>Marseilles</em> obtains its water supply from the Durance River,
at a point sixty-two miles from the city. The water is conveyed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
through an open canal (excepting the numerous tunnels)
with a fall of six inches per mile. Thirty-four millions, of the
159¾ millions total daily ordinary flow of the canal, is considered
sufficient for the city, the balance being available for
irrigation and water-power, while the waste flows into the sea.
About one-seventh of the water, as estimated, is lost by evaporation
and filtration. There were five settling basins, with a
water surface of 220 acres, constructed along the line of the
canal, designed to increase <ins class="corr" id="tn-90" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'the depurition of'">
the deposition of</ins> the heavier particles
of sediment by diminishing the velocity of the water. Only
one of these basins was serviceable in 1868. The largest one
was used for a short period only, because of a defect in the
construction of the dam; the others were abandoned because of
the neglect in or difficulty of withdrawing the sediment. A costly
filter gallery was built at Longchamp, consisting of two apartments,
with a series of arches in the center, forming the bed
for the filtering material and the cover for the collecting reservoir
for the filtered water. The plan was abandoned in 1866,
because of the unusual amount of sediment carried down by the
Durance River, which is estimated at one thousandth part of its
volume. In 1868, there were from three to four inches of compact
mud on the sand beds, and the gallery used for a reservoir
only. Subsiding basins have since been constructed. The rate
of filtration, when the gallery was in operation, was 90 cubic
feet to the square foot, equal to 8,312,940 U. S. gallons per day
for both filter-beds, or 36 gallons per inhabitant for a population
of 230,000.</p>

<p><em>Paris.</em>&mdash;Previous to the introduction of the Vanne supply, in
1865, the city was supplied from the following sources:</p>

<p class="p1 noindent">or 39,025,713 gallons per day for 1,600,000 persons, or 25 gallons per
head.</p>

<p>The Passey artesian well increased the supply 5½ millions.
The Vanne supply has, as its source, the rivers Dhuys and Vanne.
The conduit is 83 miles long; its capacity 20 millions daily.</p>

<p>There are projected works (1876) to secure the waters of the
Mame that will increase the daily supply 25 millions.</p>

<p>The waters are generally very impure, chiefly obtained from
navigable streams. None of the water is filtered. There are two
covered reservoirs&mdash;Ménilmontant <ins class="corr" id="tn-91" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'and Moutrouge'">
and Montrouge</ins>&mdash;of vaulted
arches, after the Roman style. The pumping works are located
in the city. The daily average consumption, in 1868, was 55,861,472
gallons, or 33 gallons per head. Water is distributed
throughout Paris, but not more than one-fifth of the houses have
water connection. The others are supplied in carts and buckets,
carried by men to the door. About 7,000 men, principally natives
of Auvergne, are employed thusly. It is a custom to let
the water run for three hours, from the public fountains, in the
morning to cleanse the streets.</p>

<p><em>Bombay.</em>&mdash;The water-works were commenced in 1856. The
source is in the valley of the Goper, where the Vehar impounding
reservoir, with a storage capacity of 12,900 million gallons
is located. The maximum depth of the reservoir is 80
feet, with an area of 1,394 acres. There are three dams&mdash;one
835, one 555, and the other 936 feet long. The extreme height
of first dam is 84 feet, inner slope 3 to 1, and the outer 2½ to 1.
The embankments were made in layers of six inches. The
top width of this dam, which carries a roadway, is 24 feet.
The puddle walls are 10 feet wide at the top, and have a batter
of 1 in 8 on each side. The trenches, for the foundations, were
excavated into the solid basalt below the surface rock. The
slopes and tops of all the embankments are covered with stone
pitching 12 inches in depth, with another 12 inches of broken
stone underneath. The waste weir is 358 feet long, with a top
width of 20 feet.</p>

<p class="p1">The oldest rocks are designated by Eozoic system, consisting
of Laurentian and Huronian groups, and are metamorphic rocks
underlying a broad belt in Canada, from Labrador to the Lake
of the Woods, and thence to the Arctic Sea. It is computed
that this group of strata attains a thickness of 47,000 feet in
Canada.</p>

<p>The Potsdam sandstone, the first member of the Silurian
system, rests unconformably on the Eozoic rocks wherever the
two are found in contact. This, as its name implies, is a sandstone,
and is the first product of the invasion of the Eozoic
continent by the ancient ocean, and the action of the shore
waves upon the cliffs and surface.</p>

<p>It has been reached in the deep borings made at Columbus,
Louisville, and St. Louis. Neither the Eozoic or Potsdam
stones are exposed in any part of Ohio. Resting on the Potsdam
stone, is a formation called calciferous sand-rock, so
named in New York because there it consists of a mixture of
lime and sand. This formation holds the lead of central and
eastern Missouri.</p>

<p>Trenton limestone, with its underlying strata of chazy, Black
River, and bird’s-eye limestones, rests on the calciferous sand-rock,
and forms a calcareous mass of 300 to 600 feet in thickness.
It is exposed in New York, Canada, Lake Superior, and Upper
Mississippi, where one of its members, the Galena limestone,
claims special notice as being the repository of all that rupture.</p>

<p>Upon the Trenton rests the Hudson group, consisting of the
Hudson River and Utica slates, and composed of mixed calcareous
and argillaceous sediments. This group is regarded as an equivalent
to the blue limestones, or Cincinnati group, which are of special
interest to the inhabitants of Ohio, inasmuch as they are the
lowest rocks exposed within our territory.</p>

<p>These older rocks are brought to the surface by an axis of
upheaval, reaching from Nashville to Lake Erie. They have
been still further exposed by the cutting down of the valley of
the Ohio, near Cincinnati, where 800 feet of the series are
exposed to view. The wells on the upper Cumberland, in Kentucky,
were sunk in rocks of the Hudson age. The earthy limestones<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
of the Hudson period indicate <ins class="corr" id="tn-95" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'a shallowy and'">
a shallow and</ins> retreating sea, an approach to land conditions, and the completion of one
circle of deposition.</p>

<p>The rocks next in order are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Oneida conglomerate marks a period of land subsidence, or water
elevation. It is composed of coarse materials torn from the coast by
shore waves. The system is found in central New York.</p>

<p>The Medina sandstone.&mdash;A period of mechanical sediments. In
New York it is 300 to 400 feet in thickness. It has been struck in borings
for oil in northern Ohio, but not well marked.</p>

<p>Clinton Group, in Ohio, is represented by a limestone 15 to 20 feet
thick, an outcrop following the line of junction of the Lower and Upper
Silurian.</p>

<p>Niagara Group is above the Clinton and occupies a wide-spread
and more important formation, composed of equal masses of limestone
and shale. This is the rock that underlies Chicago. The Niagara and
Clinton overlie the Cincinnati Group.</p>

<p>Salina is the formation from which the salt is obtained at Syracuse.
In northern Ohio it overlies the Niagara, and contains the gypsum of
Sandusky. This deposition marks the era of a retiring sea, which left
a series of shallow basins that became great evaporating pans.</p>

<p>Helderburg group is the surface rock of a large area in Ohio, and
forms a summit of the Upper Silurian, and completes a circle of sedimentary
formation corresponding, in a way, with that of the Lower
Silurian.</p>

<p>The Trenton groups are nearly pure carbonate of lime, while those
of the Niagara series&mdash;Clinton, Niagara, and Waterlime&mdash;are highly
magnesian.</p>
</div>

<p>The Devonian age contains many strange forms of ancient
life. In the Mississippi Valley, the Devonian strata are mostly
calcareous, and much thinner than in New York and Pennsylvania,
showing plainly that here, as in eastern Canada, open
sea prevailed during this age, and that the Cincinnati Arch formed
a land surface probably throughout all the Devonian ages. The
Devonian system comprise:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Oriskany sandstones.</p>

<p>Corniferous limestone.&mdash;An open sea deposit. The average thickness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
in Ohio is 100 feet, and forms two belts of outcrop on opposite
sides of the Cincinnati arch. The rock contains 20 per cent. of magnesia.
Fragments of land plants and limbs of trees are found in this
group.</p>

<p>Hamilton group.&mdash;A soft, blue limestone in Ohio.</p>

<p>Huron shale&mdash;exhibits a prevailing black color, and contains 10 per
cent. of combustible matter. The line of its outcrop is marked by oil
and gas springs. It is exposed in Kentucky and Tennessee, on both
sides of Cincinnati anticlinal. It contains a large amount of carbon,
derived from sea-weeds.</p>

<p>Erie shales is the name given to the Huron shale in northern Ohio
and Lake Erie.</p>
</div>

<p>The carboniferous system is the highest group of rocks found
in Ohio, and holds nearly all the beds of coal. As this period is
not relative to Hamilton County, we shall only briefly refer to it.</p>

<p>At the period of the formation of the lowest bed of coal, the
level of the carboniferous continent would seem to have been
the highest; for when the stratum of bituminous matter had accumulated
to the depth of a few feet, it was submerged by
water, that brought shales and sandstone, and spread them in
layers of many feet in thickness above it, before the requisite
conditions were reached for the formation of another stratum.
The intervals of repose, when the surface of the land was nearly
at a level with the sea, were marked by the carbonaceous matter,
and the thickness of each stratum measures the length of time
during which this state of quiescence continued.</p>

<p>The changes of level were apparently all in one direction,
that of submergence. During the epoch of the coal measure,
the surface of the land and at the sea level, while the first
stratum of coal was forming, was depressed until there had been
deposited upon it a series of strata, which measured in Ohio,
before being eroded, fully 2,000 feet in thickness, and included
at least twelve workable seams of coal, with a great number of
thinner ones.</p>

<p>At the time of the formation of the highest coal-beds, the Alleghany
Mountain system was elevated, and an area including
most of the States of our Union was raised above the ocean,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
never again, to the present time, submerged. The anthracite
coal basins of Pennsylvania were once a part of the Alleghany
coal-field, but were isolated by the upheaval and erosion of the
mountain ridges; and by this disturbance, all the rocks were more
or less metamorphosed, and most of the volatile ingredients of
the coal driven off, leaving it in the condition of anthracite.</p>


<h4>THE DEPOSITS OF DRIFT.</h4>

<p>The period immediately following the Tertiary age [but separated
from it by we know not how many years] presents a complete
change in the physical condition, that during this time the
pervading warmth of the Tertiary was changed to an Arctic
cold. While, in the former age, the climate of our Southern
States was carried to Greenland; in the latter, or drift period, the
present Greenland was brought as far south as the Ohio. This
was when we had our icebergs or glacial age. The gravel, the
bowlders, and an unstratified clay thickly studded with small
fragments of rock, are the glacial surface-covering. Mingled
with these are found many pebbles and bowlders of crystalline
rock, such as are found north of the great lakes.</p>

<p>The finding of large bowlders in fields are the deposit of icebergs
that once floated over our country. The glaziers reached
as far as Cincinnati, planing, grinding down, smoothing all rock
surfaces, and excavating the basins of our great lakes. The retreat
of the glaciers left clay and bowlders and a great inland
sea of fresh water, filling basins, before occupied by ice, 500
feet above the present surface of Lake Erie. At a later period,
by continental elevation or the removal of barriers to drainage,
the water level was gradually depressed until the inland sea was
reduced to the comparative insignificance of our great lakes.</p>

<p>The descent of the water by motion of the waves, cut the
well-marked terraces and edges.</p>


<h4>CINCINNATI ANTICLINAL.</h4>

<p>The term, Cincinnati Group, is now applied to the blue limestone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
series, and is an equivalent, in the geological nomenclature,
to the Hudson Group of New York.</p>

<p>Its thickness is estimated at 1,000 feet. The line of upheaval
passes from the south line of Tennessee, with a direction a little
east of north, through Cincinnati to Lake Erie. Throughout
its whole length the strata are raised in a distinct arch, from
which they dip away, on the one side under the Alleghany coal-field,
on the other beneath the coal basin of Indiana and Illinois.</p>

<p>The bearing of this axis of elevation is nearly parallel with
that of the folds of the Alleghanies; that the date of its upheaval
was subsequent to the carboniferous, and anterior to the
Triassic period. The line, north of Cincinnati, extends from the
Ohio River in a direction a little east of north to the lake shore,
between Sandusky and Toledo. In consequence of the erosion,
which all the region bordering the Cincinnati Arch has suffered,
the line of the axis presents no conspicuous topographical features.
About Cincinnati the summit of the arch has been much
more deeply and extensively removed than farther north, yet
this is still higher than its northern prolongation.</p>

<p>There is every reason to believe, therefore, that this was originally
the highest part of that portion of the arch within Ohio,
and, in common with the Blue Grass district of Kentucky, the
blue limestone area about Cincinnati is the most elevated portion
of the ridge; that which has been the longest above the sea
level and suffered most from surface erosion. We find here a
line or tract from which the strata dipped on both sides in
opposite directions.</p>

<p>The strata, that are found in the tops of the Cincinnati hills,
can be followed to the eastern side of Brown County, where
they seem to disappear beneath the river with a marked easterly
dip; while below Cincinnati, near Madison, Indiana, the same
beds are carried beneath the river by a strong westerly dip.
The Cincinnati anticlinal, unlike the folds of the Appalachian
system, generally has its longer slope to the westward, and its
steeper descent towards the east, estimated at 35 feet per mile.
In the western half of the State, and especially along the summit
of the Cincinnati Arch, the dip of the strata is strongly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
northward, amounting to about 1,000 feet between the Ohio and
the lake. The surface of the Cincinnati Group is in Highland
County, about 500 feet above Lake Erie, while on the lake
shore it is nearly 400 feet below the lake. These figures do not
represent the entire dip, inasmuch as the crown of the arch is
extensively eroded where it crosses the Ohio in Clermont
County. The Cincinnati section was originally crowned, there
is little reason to doubt, with the Lebanon beds [the highest
rocks of the Cincinnati group] in whole or in part, which suffered
by erosion, forming our valleys of to-day.</p>

<p>The surface of the blue limestone, near Lebanon, is 441 feet
above Lake Erie, while the same rocks were found in the Columbus
well to be 721 feet below Lake Erie, a dip of 1,167 feet
in a distance of about 70 miles by an air line, or 16.6 feet per
mile.</p>

<p>Toward the northern extremity of the arch the dip is north-west
and more rapid, the strata descending under the Michigan
coal-field. Near the lake-shore the minimum dip is 20 feet to
the mile, while on the Ohio it is 40 feet. The easterly dip is
a succession of steps or waves beneath the trough of the Alleghany
coal-field, the axis of which passes near or beyond our
eastern border. This dip is so great that the lowest stratum
exposed on the crown of the Cincinnati arch is on the eastern
side of the State, buried about 2,000 feet beneath the surface.
East of the Ohio all the rocks rise again, and not only the lowest
exposed in our State, but even those which underlie them,
crop out on the flanks and summits of the Alleghany Mountains.
Along the Kentucky River from Frankfort to Nicholasville,
and at Murfreesboro, Tennessee, the basal portion of the
blue limestone series is exposed to view; and if it was originally
as thick at these points as elsewhere, not less than 800 to 1,000
feet of the upper part have been removed.</p>


<h4>HAMILTON COUNTY.</h4>

<p>Strictly speaking there are no hills in Hamilton County, the
surface being all referable to the tablelands and to the valleys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
worn in them. The elevated lands, called hills, are merely isolated
remnants of the old plateau, which have, thus far, escaped
the long continued inundation. This isolation is effected by the
Little Miami, the Ohio, the Millcreek Valleys, and the abandoned
channel of the Great Miami.</p>

<p>The bedded rocks of the Cincinnati section are as follows:</p>

<p>The Mt. Pleasant beds are so named because, at the Ohio River
bed at this point, they are the lowest of the exposed beds, and
underlie the lowest beds at Cincinnati by 50 feet. The Cincinnati
beds have their inferior limit at low water of the Ohio, and
for an upper boundary the highest stratum found in the Cincinnati
hills. Their greatest elevation, above low water-mark, is
450 feet. The Eden, or middle shale, is so named because of
its prominence in Eden Park hills. It has no economical
value, indeed its relation to economical interests are mainly in
the way of disadvantages to be overcome, because of its instable
character. Of the 250 feet not more than one foot in ten
is limestone, the remainder being shales, clay, or soapstones.
These shales have scarcely tenacity enough to hold their place
in steep descents, still less, when they have been removed from
their original beds, can they be made to cohere, and they form
treacherous foundations for buildings erected, or for roadways
constructed upon them.</p>

<p>The strata of river quarry-beds are comparatively but little
exposed. A moderate amount of building-stone of superior
quality is taken from the Covington quarries. But little can
be burned into lime, but the concretions constitute a hydraulic
lime of great energy.</p>

<p>The Lebanon beds, in contrast to the Mt. Pleasant beds, are
the highest of the Cincinnati group, and the location determine
their name.</p>

<p>The drift formations are divided into&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>1. Drift deposits of the highlands and slopes.</p>

<p>2. Drift deposits of the lowlands and valley drift-beds.</p>

<p>The upland drift has no uniformity in the order of formations
aside from the monotonous deposits of yellow clay, which, when
filled with water, becomes quicksand. But little clean gravel
occurs in the upland, and bowlders also are unfrequent. The
drift clays come largely from the waste of blue limestone
effected by glacial attrition, while the natural soil has the same
origin, except the work of disintegration has been done by the
slow action of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The lowland drift consists of the following terraces, in a descending
order:</p>

<p>The gravel of the Ohio differs from the Miami in being largely
composed of sandstone pebbles instead of limestone.</p>

<p>A formation of local occurrences, known as the blue or Springfield
clay, is found in a few places, but in limited, vertical and
horizontal, extent. The greatest thickness, of more than 30 feet,
is found on north Pearl Street, above Pike.</p>

<p>The broad valley, now occupied in part by Millcreek, extending
from the present valley of the Great Miami at Hamilton
to the Clifton hills, just north of Cincinnati, separates into
two branches, one passing to the north and east of the city,
and entering the valley of the Little Miami between Red Bank
station and Plainville, while the other branch is the present valley
of the Millcreek. There are no rocky barriers (nothing, in
fact, but the same drift terraces that make the walls of its present
course) to shut out the Great Miami from entering the Ohio
valley at the same points where the Little Miami and Millcreek
enter. There is every reason to believe that this was once its
course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>Another of the earlier courses of the Great Miami, is now
occupied by the Dry Fork of the White Water; still a third of
the old channels is found near Cleves, Miami Township, where
the Miami approaches within one-half mile of the Ohio, but is
blocked from entering it by a ridge 150 to 175 feet, composed
of glacial drift, and instead makes a circuitous route of 10 miles
for an outlet.</p>

<p>A remarkable feature of the Millcreek is here presented, of

<p>Underlying our drift formation is that impervious strata of blue
limestone, 1,000 feet in thickness, through which no water can
circulate. The lowest limit of this mass of stone is at low water
of the Ohio River, at Cincinnati, from which point it anticlines
in all directions. There are crevices or pockets, however, in
which water has been accidentally found. The following are

<p class="p1">The waters of the above wells are necessarily hard, although
that at Holder’s tannery is used for all purposes. The water at
John Kaufman’s is very turbid. The Freiburg &amp; Workum well
was originally a dug one, forty feet deep, but the quantity was
insufficient. When they struck the present source, they destroyed
the adjoining surface wells of Hoffheimer Bros.</p>

<p>A number of failures to secure water in this limestone formation
is on record, but we can notice only a few.</p>

<p>At Rasche Bros., tannery, on Plum Street, opposite Bank
Street, they drove a 6 inch well through, respectively, 16 feet of
clay, 4 feet quicksand, 15 feet blue clay, 70 feet yellow clay, and
solid quarry rock. A pump was then inserted but was inoperative
on account of the large amount of sand. They continued
the boring to 185 feet, striking clay and soapstone, but found
no water, and abandoned the undertaking.</p>

<p>Wm. Kirkup &amp; Son, Pearl and Ludlow, bored 60 feet into
rock, for water, without success. At Maddox, Hobart &amp; Co.’s
rectifying establishment, they have pierced the rock 150 feet,
but found no water up to this date. At Weber’s brewery, on
McMicken Avenue, an attempt was made to get water in the
rock, and abandoned, after boring to a depth of 458 feet.</p>

<p>The Cincinnati group is about 1,000 feet in thickness of blue
limestone, forming, almost exclusively, the rocks of Hamilton
County, although an outcrop of the oil stratum has been struck
in the wells of the Cincinnati Coffin Company and White Mills
Distillery. At the former establishment, flowing gas was found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
at a depth of 82 feet. Another well was started, and at the same
depth gas was discovered. The boring of the latter was then
continued into the rock to the depth of 168 feet, when water
was found. The water was analyzed by Prof. Wayne with the
following result:</p>

<p class="p1">Upon the limestone lays the drift, consisting of water-worn
pebbles, gravel, sand, and clay. The porous nature of this
formation, with the assistance of a level surface plain, absorbs
a very large percentage of the rain-fall, and produces a fertile
subterranean water supply, whose depth varies from 30 to 200
feet.</p>

<p>There are in this vicinity about 250 wells that secure the water
from this source. The water is strongly impregnated with iron
and magnesia&mdash;a ferruginous decomposition from the fossil drift-wood
found in this formation. The availability of these wells
is in proportion to the capacity of the respective pumps attached
to them, but their combined requirements have had no apparent
effect, at present, on the source. Yet the fact can not be
disputed, that this drift supply of water is a very limited one.</p>

<p>The practical experience in London and Liverpool substantiate
the above fact, for there the underground sources have been
materially lessened by the demands made upon them, notwithstanding
they are the richest resources of this nature, and vastly
superior to ours.</p>

<p>Prof. Orton, of the Ohio Agricultural College, in a valuable
paper on the “Relations of Geology to the Water Supply of the
Country,” refers to the purity of the drift water in the south-western
part of the State. He says: “The broad and fertile terraces
of the river valleys constitute, especially in the south-western
corner of the State (Ohio), the most attractive and most valuable
portion of its area. They consist of sand and gravel in large
measures, and to this structure they owe their chief attraction.
<em>But this same structure renders them unfit to be used for the water
supply of the towns built upon them</em>; for, although an abundance
of clear and sparkling water can easily be reached, it must not
only be looked upon with suspicion, but must be positively
condemned as unsafe.</p>

<p>“These gravel-beds are as porous as a sieve, and there is indisputable
proof of the free communication of the water sheet
and all the receptacles of impurity that the surface of the
ground contains. The only relief is found in the fact that the
water sheet is also in free communication with the rivers, rising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
and falling with them; <em>but</em> even <em>this</em> does not free the wells
from the poisonous effects of the filth soakage from above.
Geology turns over to sanitary science the conclusion, that the
drift wells of central and south-western Ohio are, in all densely
populated districts, small cities, towns, villages, and hamlets&mdash;even
in those containing no more than a dozen houses&mdash;<em>utterly
unfit for human use</em>.”</p>

<p>The above facts are applicable to all the drift formation, including
that portion protected from immediate filth soakage of
blue clay formation.</p>

<p>A recent examination of our sewerage system, by the U. S.
Census Bureau, developed the fact that Cincinnati is polluting its
subterraneous soil, to an alarming degree, by the vault system.
That no city has so neglected the sanitary necessity of tapping
the sewers for house drainage than Cincinnati; that this nature
of carelessness was the cause of Memphis’ sad fate, which we
have escaped because our soil is of sand and gravel, and susceptible
of natural drainage. Yet through this same soil passes the
water that is used by some 250 well-owners, still the use of this
water is increasing.</p>

<p>London was originally supplied by shallow wells in gravel-beds
of 10 to 20 feet in depth, and the direction of its growth
was controlled by this water-bearing strata, until the establishment
of the New River Water Company in 1600. The Public
Health Act of 1872 gives the sanitary authorities power to close
these wells.</p>


<h4>ARTESIAN WELLS.</h4>

<p>Beneath the Cincinnati group are the calciferous sand-rock and
Potsdam sandstone, which are porous and water bearing, but they
rise to the surface nowhere in our State. They have been reached,
however, at this point in several of the deep well-borings, and
flowing water of sulpho-saline nature was found, at the following
locations:</p>

<p class="p1">The synopsis of boring is condensed as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>July 24, 1880.&mdash;The contractor, John J. Pfeffer, drove a 6-inch iron
tube with a heavy sinker, a few feet at a time, through 123 feet of
drift, into limestone. A sand-pump was used to remove the loose
formation. This portion was completed August 2d, 11 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span></p>

<p>August 2.&mdash;Commenced drilling a 4½-inch hole through the stone
formation at an average rate of 33 feet per 24 hours, and continued
to a depth of 425 feet, when the diameter of the hole was reduced to
4⅜ inches. The drilling was then continued, at the rate of 29 feet
per 24 hours, until the 28th of August, when the socket pulled out of
pole attached to sinker at bottom of well, and at the same moment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
the top pole, attached to chain on drilling beam, broke and fell into
the well along-side of the sinker. This accident was repaired September
7th, and drilling resumed, at rate of 20 feet per 24 hours, until a
depth of 1,025 feet was reached, October 11, 1880, when the drill
broke. Resumed work, at rate of 12 feet per 24 hours, until November
5, 1880, when a depth of 1,265 feet was reached. At the
depth of 1,225 feet, the well was tested by sinking a 4-inch pipe into
the well with a bag at lower end to fit tightly into the 4½-inch bore.
When the pipe reached a depth of 15 feet below the 6-inch tubing,
the water flowed over the top of the pipe at surface, showing a leak
around the bottom of the pipe where it was bedded in the rock.</p>

<p>November 8th.&mdash;Tested well, and found a pressure of 30 lbs. per
square inch, and a flow of 90 gallons of water per minute.</p>

<p>February 17, 1881.&mdash;When testing well No. 2, the gauge was placed
on this one, which showed only 15 lbs. The bore was then increased
to 4½ inches, and drilling continued to a depth of 1,360 feet, the last
40 feet being only 3½ inches in diameter. The additional 125 feet
was through alternate formations of sand and limestone; the last 10
feet through a hard flinty formation. Boring into this last formation
increased the pressure to 41 lbs., and the flow to 200,000 gallons per
day. The outlay of the two wells is placed at $8,000.</p>

<p class="p1">The actual crest of the divide forms a singularly tortuous line
with remarkable variations of altitude. The water-sheds, with
which we are particularly interested, are found in the counties
of Shelby, Mercer, and Auglaize, where we have the water-gap
of the head-waters of the St. Marys and Auglaize, as feeders of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
Maumee River with the Wabash and Big Beaver Rivers on one
side, and the Great Miami on this side; with another gap, between
the Miami and Mad Rivers, and the Scioto River, found
in Logan and Hardin Counties, in which the highest points of
the State are found viz., 1,000 feet above low water in the Ohio
River. These streams descend very rapidly to the level plateau
(500 feet above the Ohio River) passing over lime and magnesia
rocks, through swampy lands and “cat-head prairies,” the latter
composed largely of vegetable accumulations. The population,
through which the Great Miami and Mad rivers flow, is approximately
360,000.</p>

<p>The available resources of the Big Beaver, Wabash, and St.
Mary’s water-sheds are collected in St. Mary’s Reservoir, a lake
of 47,000 acres, for feeding the Miami Canal north; while Lake
Laramie in Shelby County, and Lewistown Reservoir in Logan
County gather the waters of the Miami, and being at the summit
level, feed the canal both north and south. This level is
519 feet above low water in Ohio River, St. Mary’s 424 feet,
Eden Park Reservoir at Cincinnati 235 feet, and Third Street
Reservoir 173 feet. The distance in air line from Cincinnati to
St. Mary’s is about 95 miles, to Lewistown over 100 miles.</p>

<p>The waters of all the streams named present those features
that experience considers most objectionable for a gravity supply,
namely:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“1st. In the calcareous nature of the soil, producing hardness of
water.</p>

<p>“2d. In the low and level plateau of water-sheds from which a minimum
surface flow can be realized, requiring storage reservoirs of large
surface area, that are objectionable, because; 1. The loss of water by
evaporation: and 2. The liability to stagnation of water and propagation
of vegetation.</p>

<p>“3d. The streams are fed by the drainage from richly manured
farms, and the water polluted by vegetation of the swampy lands, and
the sewage of a large and growing population. This condition is intensified,
when we consider the proportional size of the streams to the
amount of pollution, and the fact that the most perfect means of filtration
would not suffice to make the water wholesome.</p>

<p>“4th. The available resources of these water-sheds are now used<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
for feeding the Miami Canal, from which a number of mill-owners secure
their power, whose rights must be protected.</p>

<p>“5th. The insufficient elevation of the sources for securing a fair
hydrostatic water pressure, and their extreme distance, causing loss of
head by long conduit, and enormous cost for construction, for conveying
unwholesome water.”</p>
</div>


<h4>RIPARIAN RIGHTS.</h4>

<p>The compensation to millers by the Manchester and Liverpool
Water-Works was fixed by Parliament at one third of the
available rain-fall. Nearly one-half of the present capacity of
the Glasgow supply is used by mill-owners.</p>

<p>On this subject John W. Erwin, resident engineer of the
Ohio State Board of Public Works, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The riparian right of water-users are great, and could not be purchased
for $2,000,000. The water for this purpose can not be spared.
The canal is fed as far as Middletown, by a feeder from Mad River.
At Middletown we feed it from the Miami, which furnishes its supply
of water to Cincinnati, a distance of forty-four miles. The Middletown
Hydraulic Company have owned their rights since 1808, long
before the canal was constructed; and when the canal was built there
was no surrender of such right, merely common consent to the use of
the water, but since that time more than double the amount of water
is used than was contemplated.</p>

<p>“By taking water to Cincinnati from the river, you injure the power
supplied by the river at all points between Middletown and Cincinnati,
and you would find great objections raised by users of power
along the canal. The power derived from the canal is the life-blood
of the town of Middletown, and of the mills along its banks&mdash;at Excello,
Woodsdale, Rockdale, Hamilton, Rialto, Port Union, Crescentville,
Lockland, and other places. The mills have large interests, and
would not surrender their rights without a struggle.</p>

<p>“A large portion of the water of the Miami, and at the present
time we might say half the volume of the water of the river is carried
into Cincinnati by the canal. This is more than was ever contemplated,
and is destined to injure the water-power of the river itself.”</p>
</div>

<p>The abandonment of the canal in the city, will no doubt be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
accomplished within a short time, when provisions should be
made to provide a better use for this surplus water than turning
it into Millcreek.</p>

<p>Monthly and annual quantity of water from rain and snow
reduced to water, in inches and hundredths, at Cincinnati,
Ohio. Latitude 39° 6′ north, longitude 84° 29′ west.</p>

<span class="bold">KIRKWOOD’S SURVEY.</span></h3>

<p>In 1865 the common council appointed a special commission
to investigate and report upon the best method of obtaining an
abundant supply of pure and wholesome water. The committee
consisted of L. A. Harris, mayor; Thos. H. Weasner, president
of council; D. T. Woodrow, Henry Pearce, and Henry Kessler,
trustees of water-works, Geo. F. Davis, Wm. P. Wiltsee, and
Chas. Brown, who succeeded R. B. Moore, members of council;
and A. W. Gilbert, city engineer. They secured the services
of the most eminent of engineers, John P. Kirkwood, of
New York. His instructions were to ascertain the most economical
and practical mode of supplying pure water, either from
the gathering grounds by gravity, or by pumping from the
Ohio River. No scheme was to be considered that would not
provide at least thirty millions daily, with resources for future
necessities. This limitation rejected Lick Run and Ross Run
entering Millcreek; West Fork and East Branch of Millcreek,
Duck Creek and Sycamore Creek entering Little Miami River.
Those that presented <em>fair</em> prospects for the collection of water
as regards quantity were:</p>

<p class="p1">The objections to these waters were: 1. The hardness; 2. The
contamination of richly manured farms; 3. The uncertainty of
the availability of the water-sheds. To produce the thirty millions
it required the combined area of Clear and Gregory creeks,
besides large storage reservoirs for dry seasons. The distance
of latter creek is 38 miles from the city, and 15 feet below flow-line
of Eden Reservoir.</p>

<p>He considered the waters of the Ohio most preferable <em>providing
the water was taken above the city limits</em>. The plan embraced
a pumping service with two lifts, to be located in Pendleton,
with storage and settling reservoirs and filter-beds. The elevation
of reservoir was 200 feet above low water, and would not
supply elevations above 175 feet. The estimates were:</p>

<p class="p1">The majority of the committee in recommending the plan
stated; “that they regarded the question, as to the source of
supply, as definitely settled for all time, that the Ohio River is
the only means from whence this city should derive her supply
of water. The site is as high up the river as can well be obtained
without crossing the Little Miami.” This latter consideration
they thought would be demanded fifty or one hundred
years hence. The minority report recommended the retaining
of the present system, and the construction of a new reservoir
in Eden Park,&mdash;the minority report was adopted. Had the
Eden Reservoir been completed within a reasonable period it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
would have served the purpose intended, at least for a few
years, but before it was ready for use the consumption of water
increased from five, to seventeen millions daily.</p>

<span class="bold">OHIO RIVER.</span></h3>

<p>The Ohio River above Cincinnati has a water-shed area, estimated
by U. S. Census Bureau, of 100,000 square miles, one-tenth
of which is of limestone formation. The hardness of the
water varies in proportion to the contribution from this formation.
The water, at the mouth of the Big Sandy, is .8 of a
degree hardness; at Markley Farm, 4½ to 8; at Dayton sand-beach,
7 to 8; at pump-works, 6 to 8; Eden reservoir, 7 to 9;
Eggleston Avenue sewer, 7 to 13; wells in the banks of the
river at Dayton sand-beach, 32 to 39; and those at Sedamsville 50
to 60 degrees. The well water is upland surface water. In fact,
all borings in the banks of the river secure, in more or less
degree, this nature of water.</p>

<p>In the south-western part of this State, the river flows over
the bedded rocks of the Cincinnati group, its waters alternately
impinging on one side of its banks, and depositing its earthy
matters, through the influence of sluggish currents and eddies,
on the opposite side, and forming what might be termed accidental
beds, as in the case of the Dayton sand-beach. The
material deposited is an argillaceous substance; and, with the
friction and influence of the water, is partly transformed into
quicksand. The beds do not form a part of the river in low
water, as depicted by the sketch in the last report of the Board
of Health.</p>

<p>The sediment in the Mississippi water, at St. Louis, is nearly
two per cent. of the bulk of the water; the largest portion (944
in 1,000) depositing itself within 24 hours. The Ohio River
water, at this point, is, at times, almost as bad. The sediment
forms a tenacious and impervious clay, so susceptible of solidification
that conductors of river water are only kept open by a
constant flow of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>The volume of water passing down the Ohio River is an extremely
variable one. No special gauging, however, has ever
been made to ascertain the quality; but from the surface velocities,
measured by the Chief Engineer of the Southern Railway,
we can approximately arrive at the figures</p>

<p>The slope of water surface, from water-works to bridge, was
.367 of a foot for low stage; for average stage, .403 of a foot;
and .415 of a foot per mile for high stage. The approximate
flow of water in cubic feet per second at the Southern Railway
Bridge is 5,000 feet for minimum stage, 100,000 feet for mean
stage, and 400,000 for maximum stage. The minimum flow of
the Schuylkill is 378 cubic feet per second; the Delaware, 2,000
cubic feet; the Merrimack, 2,100 cubic feet; and the Thames
River, 700 cubic feet.</p>

<p>Investigations of the influence on our climate, by the removal
of the forests, develop the fact that streams, utilized for water-power,
have become less constant in their flow than formerly.
The Ohio River has of late years exhibited greater fluctuations
of levels than ever known, and has lost its prestige as a reliable
channel of navigation. Prof. Newburg, in Vol. I of the Geological
Survey of Ohio, records an instant where a large rock,
at Smith’s Ferry, has recently become so fully exposed that on
its surface inscriptions were found, that are ascribed to a race
which once populated this country anterior to the nomadic Indians.</p>

<p>There are about 78 villages and towns and 13 cities on the
Ohio River between Cincinnati and Pittsburgh, a distance of
460 miles. The population on this portion of the river, and its
contributing streams, is over 3½ millions. The average population,
per square mile of drainage area, on the Ohio River is 47;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
above Cincinnati, 35; on the Great Miami, 109; on the Delaware,
176; on the Hudson, 172; on the Merrimack, 92½; on the
Susquehanna, 62; on the Connecticut, 78; on the Potomac, 54;
on the Schuylkill, 45; on the Thames, above water-works, 300.</p>

<p>Considerable space has been devoted to River Pollution, to
which attention is directed. The following remarks, however,
afford comparative results for the Ohio River.</p>

<p>The comparative merits of river waters, as expressed in analytic
results of pounds of sewage in each million gallons, are,
for the Ohio water at Dayton sand-beach, .82; at Markley Farm,
1.00; at the pumping works, 1.81; at Eden reservoir, 1.78; at
Eggleston Avenue sewer, 4.41; the Croton water, New York,
.98; Glasgow, Scotland, water, .65; Thames River, 4.91; London
supply, 1.33; Fresh pond, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1.50;
Mystic River, Boston, 1.87; Schuylkill River, Philadelphia,
1.58; Merrimack, above Lowell, .93; above Lawrence, .90; below
Lawrence, 1.03.</p>

<p>The Thames and Lea Rivers have been condemned by the
Rivers Pollution Commission because, as they say, there is no
hope of remedying their disgusting condition, notwithstanding
the parliamentary laws for their protection against pollution.</p>

<p>The Schuylkill River is the principal source of supply for
Philadelphia, but its water is very suspicious. Above Reading,
it is unfit for manufacturing and culinary purposes, owing to the
large amount of sulphuric acid. This acid is, however, neutralized
and considerably reduced before the water reaches Philadelphia.
The Fairmount pool is polluted by cess-pool and
slaughter-house drainage. The following means to restore and
maintain the purity of the Schuylkill water has been suggested
by Dr. Cresson:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The diversion of all sewage, now flowing into the pool of
Fairmount dam, into another channel.</p>

<p>2. The diversion of all sewage, containing fœcal and animal
matter, flowing into the river below Flat Rock.</p>

<p>3. The filtration of the sewage from all mills, to exclude solid
matter, animal or vegetable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>4. The exclusion of ammonia waste and surface wash from
gas-works, cemeteries, etc.</p>

<p>5. The cultivation of fish and of suitable plant life in and
upon the waters of the river.</p>

<p>6. The erection of suitable cascades over the reservoirs, so as
to secure the benefits of aeration to as great extent as possible.</p>

<p>7. The employment of proper prophylactic and curative
agents as occasion may require.</p>
</div>

<p>Boston obtained legislative power to protect Pegan Brook
from sewage pollution. Test cases, to compel manufacturers
to provide some other means of disposing of their drainage,
were carried to the Supreme Court, and decided in favor of the
city. Similar cases will be brought against other offenders. In
the meantime the pollution continues. The same authorities
procured a law to protect Mystic Lake, and provide other channels
for sewage. The provisions of the act were held to be
impracticable, and the law is now a dead letter.</p>

<p>The self-purification of river water is not recognized by some
authorities, but equally good authorities value its merits. The
following observations on this subject are particularly applicable
to Cincinnati:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The most efficacious means to get rid of the sewage is not
to put it into the river at all.</p>

<p>“A chemist can tell you the amount of organic matter contained
in the water, but that covers an infinite variety of matters.
He has no means of discrimination as to what is really
the ferment&mdash;the infectious material&mdash;of cholera from a great
number of other organic matters.</p>

<p>“The question is, not whether the chemist would find out
the organic matter, so much as it is, whether the germs that
disseminate the disease still have their property further down
the river. This can only be solved by the effects. <em>You might
go on using the water for years, and it might not be discovered
until some outbreak of disease occurs directly attributable to the
water.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>The practical sanitary experiment would then be solved, but
at the expense of a number of lives.</p>

<p>Dr. Klob, of Vienna, has discovered, in the evacuations of
cholera patients, millions and millions of microscopic fungi similar
in form to a mushroom.</p>

<p>There are, above the Cincinnati pumping works, six sewers
discharging their filth into the Ohio River, besides the fœcal
drainage of no less than five thousand privies, all within a radius
of less than three miles. Now, the quality of such water
is readily established, for we are putting the sewage into the
water knowing there are no means to get rid of it.</p>

<p class="p1">A recent examination of the currents of the river passing the
inlets was conclusive that the Eggleston Avenue sewer, 1,000
feet below, could have no effect on our water supply. Be this
as it may, its proximity taxes our delicate tastes. The location<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
of the inlet of the Shield aqueduct is not a desirable one,
being at the revetment wall, past which all the shore water
flows. The small aqueduct certainly can not be improved, its
inlet being sixty feet beyond the wall, where the currents produce
the best water obtainable.</p>

<p>The value of changing the location of the intakes can be
illustrated to a good advantage by the experience of London
during the cholera epidemic of 1854. After the epidemic of
1849, the Lambeth Water Company moved their intakes to
Teddington, beyond the range of London sewage; while their
competitor, the Southwark Company, continued to take its
water close to one of the sewers. Their respective water-pipes
interlaced each other; and of the 26,000 houses supplied by
the Lambeth Company, there were only 294 deaths in 1854,
while in 40,000 houses, supplied by the other company, there
were 2,284 deaths.</p>


<h4>SCOWDEN’S SURVEY OF MARKLEY FARM.</h4>

<p>On the 29th of April, 1871, the Trustees of Water-Works,
in response to the Council, submitted a report to them upon
the necessity of a new water supply. On the ensuing 9th of
June, the Council ordered that a competent engineer be employed
to examine sites, and report upon the most suitable
location for water-works, with plans, estimates of cost, etc.
Mr. T. R. Scowden was accordingly appointed; and, on the 9th
of September of the same year, he submitted a supplemental
report, recommending, in the highest terms, the “Markley
Farm” site. Upon his recommendation, the property was
purchased for the sum of $22,321.50, consisting of 146 acres,
with a river frontage of 2,000 feet. The principal points upon
which the recommendation was based were:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The site known as Markley Farm is a point where the water
of the Ohio River is deep and free from drainage or any other
vitiating influence to affect its quality, perhaps for a century to
come, if ever. The shore is bold, and, with the bed of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
river, is of gravel and rock formation, washed clean by an active
current at all seasons of the year. Pumping works may
be located at this point without any objectionable and expensive
inlet-pipe; while the adjacent hills afford an excellent site for a
storage reservoir, 307 feet above extreme low water, and 75 feet
above the Garden of Eden Reservoir. On the lower level there
is a fine plateau for locating, not only the pumping house, but
subsiding reservoirs and filtering basins.</p>

<p>“The force-main extending from the pump house to the storage
reservoir will be short, or about 1,450 feet long, whereas,
works located on the second site, or any other sites examined,
would require force mains several thousand feet in length. By
the first site, water from the river would be lifted by the pumps
and forced to the reservoir with the least amount of power, friction,
and expense of fuel to do the work. This site also commands
an excellent and safe landing for boats supplying the
works with coal.</p>

<p>“The analyses of waters lately taken at the Water-Works and
at the Markley Farm clearly indicate the superior quality, purity,
and healthfulness of the latter.</p>

<p>“It has been suggested that the offal from one or more distilleries,
said to be in operation at New Richmond, some ten miles
above the Markley Farm, would leave its taint in the water
reaching the latter point. My answer is, that in this case the
river, so slightly affected at New Richmond, and flowing ten
miles to reach the Markley Farm, would, from agitation and
dilution, and from the well-known self-purifying property of
water, become pure.”</p>
</div>

<p>Regarding the other sites surveyed he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The second, but objectionable, site for water-works was
found some three miles above the Garden of Eden reservoir,
and about the same distance below the mouth and offensive
discharge of the Little Miami River. This location, although
favorable in many respects, intercepts the drainage of the
upper portion of the city, and all of that from the Miami Valley<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
emptied into the Ohio River, which <ins class="corr" id="tn-122" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'renders that cite'">
renders that site</ins> wholly inadmissible for water-works purposes.</p>

<p>“The valley of the Miami forms a water-shed of several hundred
square miles in area. Upon the surface of this vast plain
is deposited the dead carcasses of animals, and the droppings
from cattle of all kinds. The ground is covered with decayed
vegetable matter, and the soaking of stable-yards, hog-pens,
slaughter-houses, distilleries, stagnant pools, etc. The refuse
is washed off by rain storms into the Miami, which is the common
receptacle, and thence into the Ohio River.</p>

<p>“It is only necessary, first, to disease the water, then disease
the man; and it is clear, therefore, that water-works located
below the Miami would, by wholesale pollution, disease the
whole community.</p>

<p>“There is no city in the civilized world so regardless of the
cleanliness and health of its citizens as to adopt a plan of water
supply to foist upon them the concentrated filth from sewerage
and the impurities of a stream, the water of which is only fit for
mill-power, manufacturing purposes, and for cattle to drink;
and I did not think that Cincinnati was emulous of setting the
example.</p>

<p>“With regard to intermediate points between the county line
and the mouth of the Little Miami River, I found the Ohio
River lined with sand-bars, some of which projected from the
shore nearly to the middle of the river, miles in length; while
the bottom or bed of the river was, for the most part, covered
with logs and craggy stones.”</p>
</div>

<p>His plan embraced the construction of pumping works for
raising the water, first, from the river into subsiding and filter
reservoirs, and then pumping it a second time into storage reservoirs.
The water was to flow, through 10⅓ miles of 42-inch
supply mains, into Eden Reservoir. The capacity of the pumps
was estimated at 60 millions daily. The recapitulation of cost
was:</p>

<p class="p1">In conclusion, he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I, therefore, regard the first and best site, known as the
Markley Farm, as one commanding all the advantages sought,
where works may be erected combining greater simplicity of
construction, economy of cost, and maintenance when put in
operation, than could be built at any of the other points mentioned.”</p>

<h3>No. 7.<br />

<span class="bold">MOORE’S SURVEY.</span></h3>

<p>On the 23d of January, 1882, Mr. A. G. Moore, Superintendent
of the Cincinnati Water-Works, submitted a communication
to the Board of Public Works relative to the present condition
of the pumping works and its future requirements. From
it we arrange the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The present pumps are deficient; that during the summer
of 1881 the daily demands exceeded, at times, their capacity;
and on one particular day there was a deficiency of over six
million gallons. The engines are generally of light construction,
and not sufficient for any increased loads. They are expensive
in operation and maintenance. First-class engines of
to-day would save two-thirds of the fuel used. The principal
reliance, during the summer, is the large “Shield” engine,
which is most extravagant on fuel, and has a wrought-iron<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
force-main, of weak material, intrenched 35 feet below the surface
of the street. Some of the boilers are of an age that
require them to be treated with the greatest care, and should
be condemned. The principal buildings do not afford protection
or access to the pumps in case of derangement during
average high water. The hill-top service is inadequate, and a
larger and more comprehensive system should be adopted for
the supply of the increasing territory.</p>

<p>“The subject of increasing capacity requires immediate attention;
and should the removal of the works be deemed
inadvisable, it will become essential to at once proceed with the
erection of machinery, buildings, aqueduct, and aqua-fort at
the old works. The cost of these improvements is placed at
$1,394,000; reserve engine for 1884, $618,000; and sewer in
Front Street, to carry the sewage below the works, $1,600,000.
Total, $3,612,000.”</p>
</div>

<p>His plan for Markley Farm provides for one lift of 305 feet,
with three compound pumping engines of 100 million capacity,
subsiding and storage reservoirs, and one effluent-main 62 inches
in diameter.</p>

<p>The estimate is condensed as follows:</p>

<p class="p1">The important question is presented by him, which the public
must decide, namely, whether it is a prudent policy to expend
four millions of dollars to improve the old works, and
retain all the expensive and unreliable machinery, and still
supply an impure and turbid water; or to expend an additional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
two millions for an entire new system, from a source where a
supply of pure and clear water can be secured, commensurate
with the growing city.</p>

<p>The cost of constructing water-works varies very much, according
to local features, geological structure, and kind of
scheme most suitable to the place. In Great Britain, gravitation
schemes cost from $10 to $13, and pumping schemes from
$7 to $10, per inhabitant. The average cost per head, for London,
was $20; for Liverpool, $20; for Bradford, England, $35;
for Halifax, England, $25; for Dundee, Scotland, $30; for Glasgow,
$15; for Manchester and Sheffield (each) $12 per head.</p>

<p>The average cost for a supply of 20 imperial gallons per day,
per head, for 66 towns of Great Britain having gravitation supplies,
was $8; for 48 towns, with pumping system, $5.80; and
for 11 towns, having both systems, $7. From the annual report
of Chicago, for 1880, we take the following cost, per capita,
for water-works construction: Detroit, $23.11; Newark, N. J.,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
$19.08; Wilmington, Del., $20.73; Buffalo, $18.29; Cincinnati,

<h3>WATER PIPES.</h3>

<p>The different kinds of water pipes in use are made of wood,
cast-iron, wrought-iron, and glass. For adapting wrought pipe
to practical use, various methods have been resorted to, that of
coating with asphaltum, enameling, galvanizing, and lining inside
and covering outside with cement. The latter method has
been adopted by a number of water-works; but the liability to
corrosion, from imperfect work and material, has caused its
abandonment in a number of places. The Spring Valley Water
Company, of San Francisco, have in use a number of wrought-iron
riveted pipes, coated with asphaltum, of 20 to 42 inches
in diameter. They are made of No. 12 to 14 iron (Birmingham
wire gauge), and have a hydrostatic pressure upon them
of from 200 to 400 feet. Virginia City (Nevada) water-works
laid two lines of wrought-iron pipe across the Washoe Valley,
7½ miles wide&mdash;one of 12-inch riveted pipe, and the other of
10-inch enameled, lap-welded tubes. The pressure on the pipe
at the bottom of the valley is 750 pounds. The enormous
pressure has caused a number of rivets to give out. On the
test for the respective capacities, the 10-inch pipe delivered 2½
millions per day, against two millions for the 12-inch pipe.</p>

<p>Hard water has but little effect on cast-iron pipe, due to the
carbonates; but soft water attacks it so vigorously, that it not
only gives a turbid appearance to the water, but seriously
weakens the pipe by corrosion, and the consequent formation
of concretions that reduce the capacity of the pipe. Hard
water <ins class="corr" id="tn-128" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'also cruses the'">
also causes the</ins> formation of lime deposits, that offer
great impediments to the flow of water. These obstructions
are now removed by boring tools forced through the pipe by
the hydrostatic pressure. The Superintendent of the Halifax
(N. S.) Water-Works records the cleansing of a 12-inch main,
32,000 feet long, in three-fourths of an hour. The preservation
of cast-iron pipes, and the prevention of these concretions,
are now accomplished by carefully dipping the pipe, previously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
heated to a temperature of 300 degrees, in a bath of distilled
coal tar, mixed, to a proper consistency, with linseed oil, or
an oil of the tar.</p>

<p>The Rivers Pollution Commission condemned the common
practice of using hemp in pipe joints, because it affords a nidus
for the breeding, development, and decay of animalculæ.
Turned joints were recommended.</p>

<p>The results of the observations of this commission prove conclusively
than the commonly received opinion, that soft water
necessarily acts upon lead pipes, is erroneous. The Loch Katrine
water, which is notorious for dissolving lead in water exposed
to the open air, yet no symptoms of lead poisoning have
been discovered since its introduction, eighteen years ago. The
water will act upon the lead at first, but will ultimately coat
the inside of the pipe with a vegetable deposit that prevents
further deterioration.</p>

<p>The frictional head, for a given diameter, is as the square of
the velocity nearly; and, for different diameters, inversely as
the diameters. Thus the loss of head, for each 100 feet of
clean cast pipe, the velocity being three feet per second, is
1.35 feet for a 3-inch pipe; 1.02 for a 4-inch; .679 of a foot
for a 6-inch; .407 of a foot for a 10-inch; .255 for a 16-inch,
and .204 of a foot for a 20 inch pipe. The mean coefficient of
friction, for cast-iron pipes of small size, with velocities of three
feet, is .00644 for clean pipe; .0082 for slightly tuberculated
pipes, and .012 for foul pipes.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        works.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
